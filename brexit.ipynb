      "I target date to meet, “do or die”. Yet though Boris Johnson said he would rather be dead in a ditch than extend the October 31st Brexit deadline, this week he endorsed an decision to push the date back to January 31st 2020. The focus on the election called for December 12th may have disguised this humiliating climbdown, but it is sure to be highlighted by opponents in the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all the government’s (now paused) £100m ($120m) publicity campaign to prepare for Brexit on October 31st, it has been clear for weeks that postponement was likely. Mr Johnson surprised many by securing a new deal on October 17th. But the chances of its being ratified in time for an orderly Brexit at the end of the month were always small. Indeed, Labour’s leader, Jeremy Corbyn, refused to back an election because of the risk of no-deal if there were no extension. Only with no-deal off the table did he deem an election acceptable.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ’s decision was motivated in part by the likelihood of such an election. Yet the new deadline is uncomfortably close. Despite winning parliamentary approval on October 22nd for the second reading of a new withdrawal agreement bill by fully 30 votes, Mr Johnson chose to pull the legislation in favour of his early election. Yet when the new parliament meets shortly before Christmas there will be barely 20 sitting days left to get the bill through before January 31st.\n",
      "\n",
      "What happens will depend, of course, on the result. If Mr Johnson wins a majority, he will push ahead quickly with the bill. But if his majority is small, he may still run into difficulties, especially with possible substantive amendments. It is worth recalling that in October 1971, s voted by a majority of 112 to approve the principle of joining what became the . Yet less than four months later the margin for the subsequent European Communities Act had shrunk to eight votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Mr Johnson does not win a majority, the withdrawal agreement presumably falls. Labour wants to renegotiate his deal and put it to the people in a new referendum, with Remain as an option on the ballot. The Liberal Democrats propose simply to revoke the Article 50 Brexit request, though they would be likely to support a referendum if they cannot achieve this. So would most other small parties.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet although an election that does not produce a Tory majority is now the clearest route to a second referendum, it is hardcore Remainers who seem most glum. Their expectation that Mr Johnson would find it impossible to get a new Brexit deal has been dashed. So have their hopes of getting a “People’s Vote” before an election. It was fitting that the campaign for such a vote chose this week to indulge in a bout of bloodletting and sackings redolent of the splits in Monty Python’s “Life of Brian” between the different factions fighting for the liberation of the people of Judea.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bigger point about Brexit is that, contrary to Mr Corbyn’s claim, no-deal is not off the table. It is not just that the January 31st deadline, which the will be reluctant to extend again, is close. It is also that, even if the withdrawal agreement bill becomes law, new deadlines will loom. Talks on a future trade relationship with the cannot realistically begin until March. Such a complex trade negotiation usually takes many years. And since it will no longer be conducted as part of the Article 50 divorce, but rather under Article 218, any deal will have to be ratified by all national and several regional parliaments, including Wallonia’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "It looks highly unrealistic to expect this to be done by the end of the transition period, which broadly freezes the status quo, in December 2020. That period can be extended to December 2022, but a request to do this must be made before July 1st. So within a few months, the prime minister will again face a familiar, agonising choice: does he ask for an extension of the deadline, or does he let Britain leave the with no deal at the end of 2020? Mr Johnson makes much of his promise to “get Brexit done” after the election. Yet for most of 2020 Brexit will remain top of the political agenda, no matter who wins. ■\n",
      "I , a horror video-game released earlier this year, shooting a zombie does not necessarily kill it. Even after a headshot, the beast may continue to lumber forward in pursuit of the player’s brains. The British economy has behaved in a similar fashion since the Brexit referendum of 2016. Many pundits had predicted that the uncertainty caused by the vote to leave would send Britain into recession, with unemployment shooting up and wages collapsing. But the economy has plodded on. That will work to the advantage of the incumbent Conservative Party at the election on December 12th.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smoothing through quarterly data, since the referendum the economy has grown at a quarterly rate of about 0.4% (1.5% on an annualised basis). That is far from impressive by historical standards. Surprisingly enough, however, it is about as fast as the average growth rate across the 7 over the period; President Donald Trump’s trade war has dented global economic growth. And Britain’s labour market has strengthened. The unemployment rate has continued to decline, and now sits around a four-decade low of under 4%. The share of accruing to workers in the form of wages, salaries and employment-related benefits is edging up.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two main factors are responsible for this slow but steady performance. For much of the post-referendum period consumers have been doggedly upbeat. Analysis last year from economists at the Bank of England suggested that, since the referendum, spending by Leave voters had grown more quickly than that of Remainers. The tight labour market has supported consumption spending. So has borrowing. Since the referendum, credit-card debt has grown by about 8% a year, a high rate by post-crisis standards. In early 2017 households’ savings ratio (ie, the share of their disposable income which they were setting aside) fell to its lowest level since 1963.\n",
      "\n",
      "In recent months growth in consumption spending has slowed—perhaps households became nervous as Brexit day appeared to be just around the corner. Yet another source of demand has taken its place. Breaking from its deserved reputation for fiscal austerity, the Conservative government has turned on the spending taps. A spending review in September promised £13bn ($16.7bn, or 0.6% of ) of extra funding for public services and investment. In July doctors and dentists got an above-inflation pay rise. A four-year cash-terms freeze on most working-age benefits will end in April. The budget deficit (ie, the difference between tax receipts and government spending) is once again increasing, having been on a downward path since 2010.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rise in living standards comes at a useful time for Boris Johnson, the prime minister. In Britain’s three most recent general elections, incumbents did well when real wages were rising smartly, and badly when they were not (see chart). With hindsight, it is clear that Theresa May picked pretty much the worst possible time to go to the polls: in June 2017, the month her snap election was held, real wages fell by 0.5%, largely the result of higher consumer-price inflation caused by the depreciation of the pound. This time, by contrast, Labour’s contention that the British economy needs a complete overhaul may seem less compelling.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will feast on your Keynes\n",
      "\n",
      "Like a wounded zombie, however, the British economy has not escaped unscathed. One paper from academics at Cambridge University suggests that uncertainty over trade policy has dented export prospects. Fearful of future tariffs on exports, many firms have pulled back from supplying foreign markets. That in part explains why, despite the fall in the value of the pound, which should make Britain’s wares more competitive in foreign markets, there is little sign of an export boom. Meanwhile, recent research from Nick Bloom of Stanford University, and colleagues, suggests that Brexit-related uncertainty has held back business investment—which, in real terms, is no higher than it was at the time of the referendum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Low levels of capital spending by firms will weigh on Britain’s productivity, which already has barely grown in the past decade. That will hold back increases in real wages. And the drag from Brexit will become much more noticeable when it actually happens. Over the long run Mr Johnson’s Brexit deal would reduce incomes by about 6% compared with what they would otherwise have been—only a marginally better outcome than the estimated cost of leaving the with no deal at all. The paradox of the forthcoming election is that the prime minister is likely to reap the rewards of an unexpectedly strong economy, even as he promises to hobble it. ■\n"

      "B English rugby fans will crowd into pubs early on November 2nd, hoping for a repeat of the fabled World Cup victory in 2003. Against expectations, the men’s national team has already beaten mighty New Zealand at this year’s tournament in Japan. Only South Africa remains. Eddie Jones, the coach, has rewarded youth over experience and selected England’s most ethnically diverse team of any World Cup. Does this mean that “rugger”, a firm favourite of the Old Etonian Boris Johnson, is becoming a true sport of the people?\n",

      "The legend goes that rugby was invented in 1823 when William Webb Ellis, a pupil at the fancy Rugby School, picked up the ball during a football match. This is a myth concocted to shore up the upper classes’ claim over the sport, according to Tony Collins, a rugby historian. As the game grew in popularity in northern industrial towns, wealthy teams linked to posh schools outlawed payments to players, to disadvantage teams from poor areas, whose players needed to earn money. This led to a split in 1895. Rugby league, a quicker version of the sport, developed in the north-east. Rugby union flourished in its well-heeled southern heartlands, and went on to conquer much of the rugby-playing world.\n",
      "\n",
      "This year over a third of England’s World Cup squad come from ethnic minorities, versus less than a sixth of the total population. Maro Itoje, a star forward, has noted with pride that the Red Roses have never been more diverse. When it comes to class representation, things are less rosy. A majority of the squad attended private schools at some point growing up, against around a tenth of the population. Yet many of the squad gained their school places through scholarships after their talent had been noticed, rather than relying on flush parents. Kyle Sinckler, a hulking forward, started at a London state school that didn’t even have a rugby team. After a teacher spotted his potential he was offered a place at the swanky Epsom College.\n",
      "\n",
      "The path to professionalism is still dominated by private schools. The annual St Joseph’s College rugby festival, held at the Suffolk school which charges £36,000 ($46,500) a year, is described by the , English rugby’s governing body, as “one of the most prestigious titles in schoolboy rugby”. This year three-quarters of the teams competing were from private schools. The best young players may find their way into the academy of a top-flight club, and eventually go professional. This largely happens through nominations, helping those with the best contacts.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launched a scheme in 2012 to introduce rugby to 750 state schools, focusing on poor areas. It says more than 10,000 youngsters have joined local clubs as a result. But state schools still lack the resources to teach more than a few sports. Many focus on football, which remains far more popular. This helps explain why just 5% of England’s men’s football team came from private schools.\n",
      "\n",
      "England’s rugby World Cup team is less white than ever, and may be less upper-class, too. Elite schools’ grip on the sport, however, makes its reputation as a posh pursuit harder to tackle. ■\n",
      "T , “strong and bold in character”, is made of gin and champagne. At £24 ($31), the cocktail is overpriced. But so is everything else at the Rivoli Bar in the Ritz, which with its gold leaf and reliefs of naked ladies is where the 1980s went to die. It is the sort of place where you might expect to see a luxuriously whiskered gent settling down with the Daily Telegraph and a cognac. But the 1980s were a long time ago and not many people read the Telegraph any more. Between January 2014 and September 2019 the venerable newspaper’s circulation dropped by 43%, to 310,000.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is bad news for Sir Frederick and Sir David Barclay, the 85-year-old twins who own both the Ritz and the Telegraph Media Group. The brothers are looking for buyers for various bits of their empire. The Ritz, a smart London hotel where Margaret Thatcher spent her last days, is in fine fettle, turning a neat annual profit and valued in the region of £800m—not bad for a property bought for a piffling £75m in 1995.\n",
      "\n",
      "The newspaper, on the other hand, has fared less well. The brothers bought the Telegraph Media Group, which publishes the daily and a Sunday edition, for £665m in 2004, when the business made £32m in profit and it was still possible for print media bosses to dismiss the internet as a fad. Last year the group’s pre-tax profits fell to £900,000 on revenues of £271m.\n",
      "\n",
      "The idea that a print newspaper could still be worth anything like the price the Barclays paid for it—which is reportedly what they are seeking—is optimistic. Suggestions that the Daily Mail and General Trust, which owns the Daily Mail, the Mail on Sunday and Metro, is interested are inaccurate, according to an industry insider, who suggests such rumours are spread to drum up interest.\n",
      "\n",
      "What might the paper be worth? Alex Webb, a Bloomberg columnist, reckons less than £100m on the most generous assumptions. The paper has put up an online paywall and is concentrating on subscriptions, but its focus on elderly Brexiteers does not bode well for growing its readership. Yet that does not take into account the Telegraph’s value as a trophy—and as a Boris-whisperer. Despite its financial woes, it remains a mighty force. It is the paper of choice for the wealthier residents of the English shires and is close to Mr Johnson, who, until he became prime minister, was an extravagantly paid columnist. That may be enough for a deep-pocketed investor looking to buy influence in British politics.\n",
      "\n",
      "Rumours swirl that the ruling families of Saudi Arabia and Qatar may be interested. The Saudis have some exposure to British media through a 30% stake in the business that owns the Evening Standard. Qatar’s Al Thani family already owns lots of London property and would have a strong negotiating position in a hotel-plus-paper package deal. Axel Springer, a German media giant, is also said to be interested.\n",
      "\n",
      "But with an unpredictable election due, the Telegraph’s role as Downing Street’s paper of choice is also up in the air. What is clear, says Claire Enders of Enders Analysis, a research firm, is that “it is not going to be evaluated as a purely financial investment”. As with the cocktails at the Ritz, its worth will be less about its intrinsic value than what it represents. ■\n",
      "A the London Fire Brigade had not done more to prepare for the Grenfell Tower fire, its head, Dany Cotton, had a glib answer: “I wouldn’t develop a training package for a space shuttle landing in front of the Shard.” So unlikely was such a fire judged to be, and so correct the policy of recommending people stay put, that she argued the fire brigade ought to share little blame for the tragedy on June 14th 2017, in which 72 people died. “I would not change anything we did on the night,” she said.\n",
      "\n",
      "The report from the Grenfell Tower Inquiry, delivered on October 30th, does not support her judgment. Led by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, a former judge, the first stage of the inquiry was concerned with what happened on the night. The next and final stage will take a broader look at the underlying causes of the fire, including the government’s role and the building’s design. A separate criminal investigation is looking at whether any laws were broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "When findings from the report leaked the day before its release, there was outrage that heroic firefighters had been criticised. In fact, Sir Martin pays tribute to the “extraordinary courage” of many on the night. But the report lays out in agonising detail the institutional failings of the fire brigade.\n",
      "\n",
      "They begin with a failure to learn lessons from previous fires. The risk of ones involving cladding have been known about for three decades. In 2009, during a fire at a 14-storey tower, the fire brigade struggled with the volume of emergency calls. Despite this, it was ill-prepared for Grenfell. There had been no consideration of how the tower could be evacuated, and even experienced firefighters were not trained to deal with a blaze of this type.\n",
      "\n",
      "Partly as a result, those in charge were far too slow to adapt to circumstances. By 1.26am, some 17 minutes after the fire had spread from the flat in which it began, flames had reached the top of the tower. Inside, smoke was climbing quickly. Yet still official advice—based on the belief that building regulations ensured fires were “compartmentalised”—was that residents should stay put. It was not until 2.47am, when command changed, that people were advised to escape.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inquiry does not focus only on the fire service. It notes failings in other emergency services, and says the building’s cladding helped the flames spread. Although it will wait to ascribe responsibility for the building’s problems, it finds “compelling evidence” that regulations were not met—“it would be an affront to common sense to hold otherwise.” The report recommends requiring owners and managers of towers to install alarms and to develop evacuation strategies, overturning long-established practice.\n",
      "\n",
      "Meanwhile, the fire service is instructed to improve training, communication along the chain of command and the way it deals with emergency calls. But the broader, implied suggestion is that it needs a change of culture. After the report was published, Ms Cotton told an interviewer that she disagreed that more people could have been saved if the building had been evacuated quickly. As the report notes, it appears the London Fire Brigade “is an institution at risk of not learning the lessons of the Grenfell Tower fire.” Especially if its leadership refuses to admit it got anything wrong. ■\n"

      "B at last has his rendezvous with the great British public. Mr Johnson was installed in Downing Street in July by an electorate of just 160,000 Conservative Party members. Now he has to prove himself before a larger and more critical audience. This audience will be bombarded with promises and propaganda over the next six weeks. But Mr Johnson’s unusual probationary period in Downing Street gives them a chance to judge him by his record. What have we learned about the prime minister’s political character and leadership style so far?\n",
      "\n",
      "One thing is certain: he has defied expectations, both positive and negative. Mr Johnson was frequently presented as a jovial figure—a clown or Bertie Wooster-style buffoon. He liked to make people laugh. He laced his language with eccentric phrases. He created an impression of affable disorganisation. But though he can still make people smile, he is much more focused and disciplined than anyone expected. The iron has entered his soul.\n",
      "\n",
      "A more appropriate image than a clown is that of a rugby captain. A fan of the game, who played for his college at Oxford, the stockily built Mr Johnson has brought many of the techniques of the sport to the political field. He has demonstrated a single-mindedness: everything he does is about getting the ball over the line. He has shown no hesitation about altering the composition of his team according to his changing game plan, kicking 21 Tories out of the party when they defied him and then re-admitting ten of them when the general election knocked. And he has kept his eye on the clock, using timetables and deadlines to keep the game moving—though he must regret installing “Brexit clocks” in both Downing Street and Conservative Party headquarters set to hit zero on October 31st, a deadline that he has now missed.\n",
      "\n",
      "More recently Mr Johnson has applied the same drive that he applied to Brexit to securing a general election, fixating on a particular date (December 12th) and threatening to go on strike if the opposition parties didn’t bend to his will. This has produced some criticism about moving the goal posts. Philip Hammond, a former chancellor, accused Mr Johnson of “blocking Brexit” in order to pursue a wider objective of shifting the Tory party to the right. That is not quite right. Mr Johnson calculates that he can’t get his Brexit deal through the current House of Commons without endless amendments and delays. He also realises that his deal is only the opening salvo in prolonged negotiations which will shape what sort of Brexit Britain ends up with.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second image is that of a greased piglet. This comes courtesy of David Cameron, Mr Johnson’s junior at Eton by two years and senior in Downing Street by nine, who recently told an audience in Yorkshire that “the thing about the greased piglet is that he manages to slip through other people’s hands where mere mortals fail.” Mr Johnson has broken an ever-lengthening list of pledges. He pledged to deliver Brexit “do or die” by October 31st, only to discover that he couldn’t. He promised to be “dead in a ditch” rather than send a letter asking for an extension, only to send exactly such a letter. He so alienated his colleagues that he reduced his majority from plus one to minus 45. But the grease works. Mr Johnson either wriggles through loopholes (for example, by refusing to sign said letter) or else shifts the blame expertly to anyone but himself. “It’s Parliament’s fault, it’s the opposition’s fault, it’s the Benn act, it’s Germany, it’s Ireland,” proclaimed an exasperated Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman, trying to define the prime minister’s slippery style.\n",
      "\n",
      "The third image is that of Machiavelli. Mr Johnson employs all the great Florentine’s tactics. He treats his opponents as enemies of the people. He throws his allies under the bus as soon as they cease to be useful (the decision to sacrifice the Tories’ long-standing ally, the Democratic Unionist Party, in order to solve the problem on the Irish border will go down in the annals of realpolitik). He uses his clown’s mask to great effect to conceal his Machiavellian side, saying toxic things one moment and telling a good joke the next. He breaks the rules of politics in ways that shock old hands such as Sir John Major. He persuaded the queen to prorogue Parliament on spurious grounds and was subsequently slapped down by the Supreme Court. And he employs a hatchet man in the form of Dominic Cummings, his chief adviser, who happily takes the blame for some of Downing Street’s more extreme moves. Mr Cummings’s enthusiasm for using privileged briefings in order to turn the press corps into an amplifier has aroused the ire of one of Fleet Street’s most experienced journalists, Peter Oborne, who wrote a furious article arguing that Downing Street is filling the press with lies, smears and character assassinations. The Downing Street machine continues with business as usual while Mr Oborne has given up his political column in the Daily Mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The last image is that of the gambler. Mr Johnson has spent his career making lucky bets—lucky for him, that is, not the rest of the country. He made his career as a journalist betting that the public wanted bureaucracy-bashing stories from Brussels, rather than the usual dutiful fare. He became prime minister by betting on Leave. Now he is making yet another gamble, which may free him from today’s imprisonment by Parliament but could easily install Labour’s socialist leader, Jeremy Corbyn, in Downing Street. The Tories go into this election facing big losses in Scotland and the Remain-voting south of England. They have to overcome powerful tribal ties to Labour in Wales, the Midlands and the north in order to make up for these losses. Moreover, Labour is a much more impressive electoral machine than most Tories seem to think. Mr Corbyn already has a new spring in his step and the party is bombarding the internet with clever ads. Even the luckiest of gamblers sometimes loses—and even the greasiest of piglets sometimes ends up in the abattoir. ■\n",
      "“I man polishing his Ford Sierra—self-employed electrician, dad always voted Labour,” began Tony Blair when describing the type of voter Labour would be after, ahead of his 1997 general election victory. It was, Labour’s thinking went, these middle-of-the-road voters—suburban car-washers in the West Midlands—who held the keys to Downing Street. Two decades later, political parties heading into the election on December 12th will find it much harder to identify the voters who will propel them to power.\n",
      "\n",
      "For years, politicos held to the “median-voter theory” beloved by Mr Blair. The idea was that the party that focused on the concerns of the typical voter would triumph, while parties that catered to the fringe would be punished. In this world the centre did more than just hold: it ruled.\n",
      "\n",
      "These laws of political science have since come crashing down. Since Brexit sliced through traditional political alliances, politics has become less of a simple matter of left versus right. Parties hammering out manifestos and preparing leaflets for swing seats are thus grappling with “Schrödinger’s median voter”, argues Marcus Roberts, a pollster at YouGov: they are unsure whether this mythical figure is alive or dead.\n",
      "\n",
      "If Brexit dominates the coming election, the median voter will be no more. When it comes to leaving the European Union, voters have polarised. There is little sign of compromise between the Remain and Leave camps. Fishing in the gap between these two pools of votes will land few votes, points out Chris Prosser of the University of Manchester. When elections are fought on economic issues, between left and right, political parties can pick a point in the middle and not go far wrong. By contrast, “identity politics do not have give and take,” says Geoffrey Evans of Oxford University. It is relatively easy to compromise on, say, the level of tax. It is harder to do so on notions such as sovereignty.\n",
      "\n",
      "As voters are polarising, so are s. More than 50 are preparing to stand down in December, including many Tory former Remainers. Most of their successors will be fully paid-up Leavers.\n",
      "\n",
      "This division of politics into two opposing camps has been dubbed Ulsterisation. In Northern Ireland, most people vote along sectarian lines. Irish nationalists will not carefully weigh up the economic policy of the Democratic Unionist Party before casting their vote. Nor will ardent unionists consider the merits of Sinn Fein’s social policy. If Brexit divisions persist, British politics could start looking more Northern Irish, with Remain and Leave the new sectarian divide (Remainers have already discovered a love of marches).\n",
      "\n",
      "Smaller parties have seized on this strategy. The Liberal Democrats are standing on a policy of revoking Article 50 and cancelling Brexit altogether. At the other end of the political see-saw sits the Brexit Party, which has pledged to quit the without a deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a Brexit-dominated election, few swing voters will switch between these two opposing groups. But plenty of switching could go on within them, says Chris Hanretty of Royal Holloway, University of London. Recent years have seen unprecedented political promiscuity, as Remainers have joined the Lib Dems and Leavers the Brexit Party (see chart). In this sense, the median voters have not disappeared, but fragmented: parties can still chase the centre ground, but only within the confines of their own sectarian group of Remainers or Leavers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all are convinced that Brexit identities are here to stay. British politics has been marked by extreme volatility of late. Only half of voters backed the same party in the three elections between 2010 and 2017, according to the British Election Study. It is not inevitable, then, that Brexit will be the issue that cements hitherto floating voters into one part of the political spectrum, argues Mr Roberts of YouGov. Talk of an election has already led to a sharp drop in voters highlighting Brexit as the main issue facing Britain, with other topics, such as the health service, rising in salience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others think the median voter has not gone missing but is simply being misidentified. Labour has stopped triangulating on the economy, instead leaping leftward with promises of a much bigger state (see Briefing). The party’s bet is that the median voter is in fact perfectly happy with its left-wing economic policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tories have taken a similar approach to social issues. A reluctance to compromise runs through their policies on law and order, which are unapologetically illiberal. The party is betting that the median voter is alive and well, and simply more socially conservative than previously thought. What looks like a failure of median-voter theory is often a failure of commentators to spot where the true median lies, argues James Morris, another pollster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite their sketchy record on the topic, wonks are still on the hunt for the new Mr Median. Past elections have seen parties target archetypes such as “Mondeo Man”, “Worcester Woman” and “Pebbledash People”. The 2019 contest has already coughed up “Workington Man”, a rugby-league-loving, Leave-voting northerner who, by coincidence, holds many of the same views as Onward, the Tory think-tank that discovered him. Perhaps Workington Man will yet hold the balance of power. But in the polarised campaign ahead, parties seem more intent on rallying their own side than on venturing into the increasingly treacherous middle ground. ■\n"

      "FOR SOME weeks Boris Johnson, Britain’s prime minister, has been demanding an early general election. But he has been stymied because the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act (FtPA) requires a two-thirds majority of MPs to agree to such an election—and the Labour opposition has refused to vote for one. Now Mr Johnson has got his way after parliament voted by 438 to 20 to hold an election on December 12th. Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, had belatedly come round, now that his condition of avoiding any risk of falling out of the European Union without a deal had been met, thanks to the EU’s decision this week to extend the Brexit deadline from October 31st to January 31st 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson wanted the December election because he is confident of winning. The Tories have a double-digit poll lead over Labour (see our poll tracker). As a newish party leader and prime minister, he believes he can campaign more effectively than his opponents. He has just won a new Brexit deal in Brussels, enabling him to appeal to voters under the slogan of “let’s get Brexit done”. Mr Corbyn’s novelty value has faded after four years as Labour leader and he is plumbing new depths as the most unpopular opposition leader in 45 years. Yet despite this the election remains a big gamble for the prime minister, for several reasons.\n",
      "\n",
      "One is that the electorate has become more volatile. Party loyalty is much weaker than it was and switching parties between elections is more common. Many voters now identify more strongly with having been Remain or Leave supporters in the 2016 referendum than with either of the two main parties. An election in which four parties (the Conservatives, Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the Brexit Party) are running in double figures in the opinion polls, and in which tactical voting may be widespread, is inherently unpredictable, as many political analysts have conceded.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second, there are several parts of the country where the Tories are likely to lose rather than gain seats. These include strong Remain areas such as London, parts of the south-east and university towns. The Lib Dems are hoping to make substantial gains in these places, and also in their traditional strongholds in the south-west. In Scotland the Scottish National Party (SNP) is expecting to win more seats, not least because the Conservatives have lost Ruth Davidson, a popular Scottish Tory leader. Mr Johnson hopes to more than make up for such losses by winning over Labour Leavers in the north and midlands, but this may be harder than he thinks. Although they may have backed Brexit in 2016, many such people have never voted Tory in their lives.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, Brexit is potentially a third awkward problem. Mr Johnson is trumpeting the new deal he has secured, but he is also seen to have abandoned his bid to push it through Parliament. That has meant missing his self-imposed deadline of delivering Brexit by October 31st, “do or die”. The election can expect to feature many replays of his declaration that he would rather be dead in a ditch than ask for an extension of the deadline, which he has now had to do. He may succeed in blaming recalcitrant MPs for failing to pass Brexit. But the Brexit Party under Nigel Farage is likely to run candidates against the Tories on a platform of not trusting Mr Johnson and preferring a no-deal Brexit instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fourth, though Mr Johnson hopes to fight the election on the basis of his ability to get Brexit done, voters could choose to focus on other issues. Mr Johnson promises to spend more on the National Health Service and schools and to hire more police officers. Yet the Tories have been in office for nine years, and they are still blamed by many for a long period of austerity and public-spending cuts. If the fight turns into one over who can do most to boost public services, Labour (and the Lib Dems) have a natural advantage.\n",
      "\n",
      "The betting is still that, with his poll lead and high popularity, Mr Johnson will win a majority in December. But there is much scope for the election to go wrong for him. When his predecessor, Theresa May, announced in April 2017 that she was calling an election in June, she had a far bigger poll lead than Mr Johnson has now. Yet when the results came in, she had lost her majority and faced a hung parliament instead.\n",
      "A , another missed Brexit deadline. Yet Boris Johnson came tantalisingly close. On October 17th the prime minister confounded his critics by wringing a new withdrawal agreement out of his fellow leaders in Brussels. Two days later, in a rare Saturday sitting of the Commons, he failed to win parliamentary endorsement for the deal only because s, who were nervous that he might still take Britain out of the with no deal at all on October 31st, voted instead to put off formal approval until the necessary legislation had been passed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Intent on leaving at the end of the month, Mr Johnson published the 115-page bill to give effect to the deal on October 21st, with a timetable motion suggesting that Parliament should pass it through all its stages in only a week. The next day he won approval for the bill at second reading. But his ludicrously short timetable was rejected by s (previous treaties have taken weeks or even months to be ratified). Although many s made clear that they had voted for the second reading only so as to propose substantial amendments to the bill, Mr Johnson claimed they had “passed” the deal and accused the Labour opposition leader, Jeremy Corbyn, of just trying to delay Brexit. Rather than accept a pause, he petulantly threatened to pull the bill and demand an early election instead.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet delay is coming. As required by the Benn act passed by Parliament last month, Mr Johnson had already written to the to ask for a three-month extension of the Brexit deadline, from October 31st to January 31st. He accompanied this letter with a second in which he suggested to other leaders that any extension would be damaging. Ignoring this, Brussels was preparing this week to accept the prime minister’s formal request for more time, though it may suggest a shorter period than three months. Mr Johnson is thus certain to break his many loud promises to get Brexit done on October 31st, do or die.\n",
      "\n",
      "Amid the shenanigans there was only limited debate about the content of Mr Johnson’s new deal. What drew most attention was its replacement for the backstop to avert a hard border in Ireland in all circumstances by keeping the entire United Kingdom in a customs union with the . The new deal ditches this in favour of a Northern Ireland-only “frontstop” which, in effect, will keep the province alone in a customs union, and also aligned with most rules. Because mainland Britain may diverge, this will require customs as well as regulatory checks in the Irish Sea. This week Mr Johnson insisted, implausibly, that these checks would only be light. He also claimed, incorrectly, that the entire scheme would evaporate as soon as Britain signed a free-trade deal with the .\n",
      "\n",
      "Not surprisingly, the new Brexit deal has incensed the prime minister’s erstwhile allies, the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party ( ). The party noted that Mr Johnson had assured them that no British government would ever accept border controls in the Irish Sea. Nor was it mollified by his attempt to give them some say over the deal. Far from giving the a veto, as Mr Johnson had proposed, the agreement requires an absolute majority of the Northern Ireland assembly to opt out. It can do this only every four years and would have to agree to some replacement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The new withdrawal agreement also drops Mrs May’s plans to remain aligned with Brussels on many single-market regulations as well as customs. Instead, Mr Johnson’s vaguer promises to maintain a level playing-field for most such rules have been put into the non-binding political declaration that accompanies the withdrawal agreement. As Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, says, this means that the , nervous of being undercut, will offer Britain only a relatively thin free-trade deal. That implies a harder Brexit with more trade barriers than Mrs May’s deal, raising the costs to the economy of leaving the .\n",
      "\n",
      "Sajid Javid, the chancellor, refuses to publish an economic-impact assessment of the new Brexit deal, saying simply that it is self-evidently good for the country. But the in a Changing Europe, an academic think-tank, has produced one of its own. Allowing for knock-on productivity effects, it finds that, after ten years, Mr Johnson’s deal will reduce incomes by 6.4% compared with what they would otherwise have been, equivalent to some £2,000 ($2,600) per person. That figure is £500 more than the estimated cost of Mrs May’s deal, and only £500 less than the income loss per person from leaving the with no deal at all.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will happen next? Mr Johnson seems to have rowed back from his threats to drop the withdrawal agreement bill entirely. If a revised timetable can be approved, detailed scrutiny may even begin next week. But although they cannot change the treaty itself, s are likely to amend the bill before it passes. An amendment to add a confirmatory referendum seems unlikely to succeed. But one requiring the government to work towards a customs union might pass despite Mr Johnson’s opposition. So could an amendment giving s the power to demand an extension of the transition period, which expires in December 2020 but can be extended to 2022. s fear that, if Mr Johnson refuses to invoke this extension, a no-deal Brexit may loom again should a free-trade deal not be struck in time—which it probably will not be.\n",

      "Mr Johnson still wants an early election, not least because the Tories are ahead in the polls. Some of his advisers talk of holding one as soon as December. But the Fixed-term Parliaments Act means that the prime minister needs the support of two-thirds of s to call an election. In September Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, promised to agree to one as soon as the threat of a no-deal Brexit was lifted. His advisers are torn. Some fret that Labour will do badly in an early election. Others think it might do even worse if Mr Johnson manages to get his Brexit deal through.\n",
      "\n",
      "One way or another, an election is likely in the next few months. And then Mr Johnson’s final falsehood will be exposed: that his deal means Brexit is done and dusted. In truth, the withdrawal agreement is but the beginning. Hard negotiations on transition, trade, security and more will take up most of the next few years. As Denis MacShane, a former Labour Europe minister, entitles his new book on the subject, what really lies ahead is “Brexiternity”.■\n"

      "B referendum in 2016 European Union flags were as rare as golden eagles in Britain. Today they are as common as sparrows. Parliament Square is permanently festooned with them. Activist Remainers flaunt flag-themed berets and -shirts. On October 19th a million-strong army of People’s Vote supporters marched on Westminster beneath a sea of gold and blue standards.\n",
      "\n",
      "This points to one of the oddest paradoxes in this odd period in British politics. It took a vote to leave the to shock millions of Britons into realising how much they liked it. Britain had always been an outlier in believing that the ought to be little more than a convenient trading arrangement. A couple of Eurobarometer polls in 2015 found that the country came 28th out of 28 in terms of people’s sense of European identity and 26th in terms of trust in European institutions. Yet today a significant section of the population thinks that being European is essential to its identity.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is part of a bigger paradox: the more Britain struggles to leave the , the more it embraces European-style politics. Since the dawn of the democratic era Britain has practised two- or two-and-a-bit-party politics compared with the continent’s multi-party system. That is changing, accelerated by Brexit. The Scottish National Party controls Scotland. The ruling Conservative Party is 45 s short of a majority. The European Research Group of hardline Brexiteers acts as a party within the Tory party. The Liberal Democrats could make big gains in the forthcoming general election, especially if Brexit seems reversible.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the past three years British politics has hung on problems that are familiar to continental politicians, such as the difficulty of assembling coalitions with minority parties and the power of disgruntled factions to exercise a veto. It has also endured the disadvantages of continental politics without the advantages.\n",
      "\n",
      "The case for the British two-party system is that it produces “crunchy” results even at the price of leaving a large section of the population feeling disenfranchised. Lately it has lost the redeeming feature of crunchiness. Theresa May had to rely on the votes of ten politicians to keep her government afloat. Boris Johnson, having lost 23 Tory s, is living in parliamentary purgatory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Creeping Europeanisation can also be detected in the rise of the far right. The British two-party system was masterful at marginalising extreme figures such as Oswald Mosley and Enoch Powell. A more fragmented system is now making room for them in Britain just as it made room for Marine Le Pen in France, Matteo Salvini in Italy and Viktor Orban in Hungary. Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, and before that his Independence Party, have terrified mainstream politicians by winning seats on local councils and in the European Parliament.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even as it becomes more European, British politics is also becoming more American. It is beginning to polarise around issues of culture and identity in much the same way as American politics has polarised. Politics is no longer about who gets what (which is always a matter of compromise) but about profound questions of identity (which is not). British politics is also becoming more presidential. Jeremy Corbyn remains on top of the Labour Party despite the hostility of his fellow s. Tories elected Mr Johnson as their leader not because he dutifully climbed the ranks but because of his star power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain has relied on an unwritten (or at least uncodified) constitution, in sharp contrast to the United States and Europe. But leaving the has raised constitutional questions that demand more than improvised answers. It has also raised the possibility that Britons will lose the panoply of rights guaranteed by the . Britain has done a good job of preventing the courts from interfering in politics. Again, Brexit is changing that. The Supreme Court’s decision to overrule Mr Johnson’s proroguing of Parliament could be the beginning of a new period of judicial activism.\n",
      "\n",
      "High on the list of British oddities is that it is a composite of four nations—England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Holding this group together was always difficult given the different sizes of the parts (England is ten times as populous as Scotland) and the history of internal colonisation. It has been made vastly more difficult by Brexit because Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to remain. Brexit increases the chance that Scotland will claim independence and, in the longer term, that Northern Ireland will join the Irish Republic. It also increases the pressure for American- or German-style federalism. The only way to prevent England from being seen to ride roughshod over the smaller nations of the United Kingdom may be to create regional assemblies or more powerful metropolitan governments.\n",
      "\n",
      "A future Conservative government might be able to reverse the drift away from exceptionalism. If Mr Johnson can win a working majority, he will no longer depend on maverick factions and therefore will be less likely to end up in the Supreme Court. If he can bind Scotland and Northern Ireland to England by big spending on infrastructure, as he plans, he might be able to head off the forces of nationalism. If he can bring off Brexit, he may be able to asphyxiate both the Brexit Party and the Liberal Democrats.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a lot of “ifs”. Though it has been reinforced by Brexit, the de-exceptionalisation of British politics began well before 2016 with New Labour’s embrace of both constitutional reform and a presidential style of government. It also feeds on powerful forces that have nothing to do with Brexit, such as the collapse of deference and the rise of celebrity culture. Moreover, the next election could produce another hung parliament, which will make pressure for voting reform and constitutional reform irresistible. Whatever happens in the Commons in the next few weeks, the dream of some Brexiteers, of restoring Britain to what it was before it entered the , is for the birds.■\n",
      "I how many migrants are in Britain illegally. It could be around 650,000—give or take a couple of hundred thousand. Nor is it known how many enter the country without permission every year. Maybe 40,000; maybe substantially more or less. Undetected entries are by definition impossible to measure.\n",
      "\n",
      "What is known is that people will take enormous risks to enter Britain. This was made tragically clear again on October 23rd, when Essex police announced the discovery of 39 bodies inside a refrigerated lorry that was registered in Bulgaria. The driver, a 25-year-old man from Northern Ireland, has been arrested.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is also clear that tightening security on one route tends to divert people to other ones. Lorries coming into the port of Dover from Calais may be searched by canine units, -ray machines, carbon-dioxide sniffers and heartbeat monitors. In 2016 the National Crime Agency warned that people-smugglers were diverting operations to less busy ports, such as Purfleet, where this lorry seems to have arrived from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Its journey ended at a nearby industrial estate.\n",
      "\n",
      "As The Economist went to press, it was reported that the migrants discovered in Essex were Chinese. If so, it would be the second such tragedy. In 2000, 58 Chinese migrants died in a lorry that was found in Dover. In 2014, 35 Afghan Sikhs were found in a shipping container in Tilbury, not far from Purfleet. Most survived.\n",
      "\n",
      "Though reliable numbers are scarce, researchers reckon that most irregular migrants enter Britain on legitimate tourist visas, then stick around. Many others use forged documents. Those arriving on boats across the English Channel, or hiding in the backs of lorries, are often the sort of people who would find it hard to obtain a visa. “The British government has a deliberate policy of making it difficult to reach the to claim asylum. So people from countries that have a higher rate of asylum will find it harder to get tourist visas,” says Madeleine Sumption of Oxford University.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tragedies on this scale have occurred in other countries. In 2008 the air-conditioning in a seafood container lorry failed in Thailand, killing 54 out of 121 migrants from Myanmar. A few years later 43 of 113 migrants bound for South Africa suffocated in a lorry. In 2015 Austrian police discovered an abandoned lorry with 71 refugees who had suffocated in the refrigerated container. All were from Iraq, Iran, Syria and Afghanistan. Nine people died of overheating in a sweltering truck in Texas in 2017. All of these calamities involved refrigerated containers. It is harder to detect people in such vehicles than in soft-sided ones, says David Wood, a former boss of immigration enforcement at the Home Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "Politicians promise to crack down on the gangs that smuggle people; advocacy groups argue for changes to migration rules. There has been no serious talk of changing the design of the lorries themselves. In the mid-20th century American lawmakers started requiring fridge-makers to use magnetic strips instead of latches after reports of children climbing into disused fridges and suffocating inside. Making it easier to get out of lorries is politically simpler than making it easier to get into countries. It would also save lives. ■\n"

But other assembly members did not turn up at the session, or left quickly, so the ’s bid failed. It is not the most humiliating thing that has happened to the party this month.\n",

A party that most Britons probably thought of as cranky and obsessive (if they thought about it at all) was suddenly powerful. Conservatives praised the union and promised more cash for Northern Ireland. The was just as keen on Boris Johnson, Mrs May’s successor, who assured the party that no British prime minister could countenance a separation between Northern Ireland and mainland Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "A party founded by a Protestant preacher ought to have remembered the Biblical injunction not to put your faith in princes. Mr Johnson has betrayed the by striking a deal with the European Union that would bind Northern Ireland closer to Ireland than to Britain for trade purposes, in practice if not in law. The party has learned, painfully, that English Conservative politicians care more about leaving the than about the union with Northern Ireland. “We’ve been ed again”, screamed the Northern Irish edition of the Daily Mirror.\n",
      "\n",
      "The party took some revenge by voting against Mr Johnson’s deal on October 22nd, and against an accelerated timetable for considering it. The has warned Mr Johnson that he should expect more such payback. That prospect might give unionist politicians some grim satisfaction. But it does not solve the party’s problems. Nor does it begin to empty the well of grievance among ordinary unionists.\n",

      "Its misadventure in Westminster is not the ’s only misjudgment of recent times. A disastrous scheme that subsidised fuel for agricultural boilers, in which Arlene Foster, the ’s leader, and other party figures were involved, wasted hundreds of millions of pounds. The report of a public inquiry into the debacle, due in December, is expected to heavily criticise leaders. Ms Foster might not survive it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson’s deal is even more painful. Although it might profit Northern Ireland economically (see article), it has revived the ancient dread that the province is sliding out of the United Kingdom. Sinn Fein, which wants a united Ireland, pointedly did not criticise the deal much. The Johnson affair has also revealed how few firm friends the has. The British government, the and the Irish government all seem to be against it. The party has even been abandoned by the “Spartans” of the Conservative Party, who once followed its lead on Brexit.\n",
      "\n",
      "The will probably remain the largest unionist party in Northern Ireland. Its rivals for that status are much smaller and weaker. Besides, unionist voters tend to circle the wagons during a crisis. But the feeling of betrayal among unionists is worrying. And those who prize peace in Northern Ireland should fret about how that feeling might be exploited by the remnants of the loyalist paramilitary groups that still roam the back streets of Belfast, dealing in drugs and terrorising local people.\n",

      "In the past, loyalist protests over what began as minor disputes, including over the flying of flags over public buildings, have been seized on by paramilitary chiefs. They have encouraged youths to riot, thus blooding them for future paramilitary careers. Jim Wilson, a community worker in the loyalist stronghold of east Belfast, estimates that some 340 youths acquired criminal records during the flag protests of 2012-13. “Now people are very angry about Brexit,” he says.■\n",
      "I 1980s British officials worried about how Hong Kong’s inhabitants would be treated once the city-state was back under Chinese control. Civil servants entertained a tongue-in-cheek plan to move them to Northern Ireland, providing a “possibly happy outcome to the uncertainties”. The scheme never materialised. But although Northern Ireland did not take Hong Kong’s people, it might import its economic model.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boris Johnson’s Brexit withdrawal agreement, finalised on October 17th, would in effect turn Northern Ireland into an entrepot—an arrangement not dissimilar from the “one country, two systems” relationship between China and Hong Kong. Northern Ireland would be in a de facto customs union with the , following many of its regulations on food and manufactured goods—thus removing the need for a hard border with Ireland. No matter what long-term arrangement Britain eventually makes, Northern Ireland would enjoy fairly free trade in goods with the bloc, while remaining part of the . It would benefit from future trade deals signed by Britain and possibly by the . Dominic Raab, the foreign secretary, argues that it is a “cracking deal”.\n",

      "If Mr Raab is right, it would be a fillip for an economy already enjoying a strong spell (see chart).

Though it remains less wealthy, the province’s poverty rate is no longer higher than the British average. Unemployment is lower.\n",
      "\n",
      "The deal might encourage some firms to relocate to Northern Ireland. It would have a unique status: manufacturers could export to European and British markets with zero tariffs and few regulatory barriers, argues Sam Lowe of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank. A research paper published in March assessed the impact of a Brexit deal similar to the one just agreed. Relative to the “no-Brexit” counterfactual, foreign investment into Ulster by manufacturing firms rose slightly.\n",

On October 21st Stephen Barclay, the Brexit secretary, suggested that Northern Irish exporters would have to fill in paperwork in order to sell to the rest of Britain.

      "I 33 years as its , Margaret Thatcher grew fond of Finchley, a green and pleasant pocket of north London. She particularly admired its Jewish population, which then—as now—comprised about a fifth of the electorate. “My, they were good citizens,” she marvelled, “not just talking, but doing and giving.” The adoration was mutual. Locals rewarded her with more than half their votes at each election she fought as Tory leader. In most other post-war elections, Tories won the seat, which was renamed Finchley and Golders Green when its boundaries were redrawn in 1997. Labour held it for 13 years, under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown. The Liberal Democrats have never come close.\n",
      "\n",
      "They now hope to break the drought. Despite picking up only 7% of the vote at the last election, the Lib Dems are fielding one of their most high-profile candidates, the former Labour Luciana Berger. A survey by a reputable pollster (albeit commissioned by the Lib Dems) predicts she will notch up 33%, enough to topple the incumbent Tory, Mike Freer. Labour, which has yet to pick its candidate, is on 21%. About half of those who backed Labour in 2017 say they will vote for Ms Berger.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason for this turnaround is unique to the candidate and the seat. Ms Berger quit Labour in February (initially for Change ) in part because of anti-Semitism. She says she could not stand for election in a party run by Jeremy Corbyn, a “morally reprehensible” leader she has accused of standing by while such sentiment took root. Finchley is far from Ms Berger’s current seat, in Liverpool, but is an obvious choice since it is already her London home and houses much of her family. It also has more Jewish residents than any other constituency. One Lib Dem strategist says the choice is a good example of the party’s knack for picking the right candidate for the right seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not hard to find constituents who praise Ms Berger’s stand against Mr Corbyn. In the Salt Beef Bar just off the busy North Circular Road, there is a fast trade in that Jewish staple and bowls of steaming barley soup. On one table a copy of the Jewish News reports that Louise Ellman, another Labour , has quit the party over anti-Semitism. The next page’s headline booms: “Berger looks golden”. One synagogue worshipper describes her as a “refugee from anti-Semitism”. Some call her “heimish”, or “one of us”, a reference as much to her local roots as to her faith.\n",
      "\n",
      "Plenty of Jews will vote for Mr Freer, a diligent local . In any case, as Ms Berger points out, most voters even in Finchley are not Jewish. The second and more significant reason for the Lib Dems’ optimism is Brexit. More than two-thirds of the seat’s voters backed Remain in the referendum. Ms Berger reckons many will be won over by her new party’s pledge to revoke the mechanism that triggered the Brexit negotiations. The same logic explains why Chuka Umunna, a fellow Lib Dem defector from Labour and Change , is standing in the Cities of London and Westminster seat.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Freer voted Remain but now believes it is his democratic duty to implement Brexit. Internal polling put the Lib Dems ahead even before Ms Berger was picked to fight the seat, claims a party official, suggesting that Brexit is the most important reason for the swing. Party membership in Barnet had already more than doubled since the referendum, to around 500.\n",
      "\n",
      "An earlier election would be better for the Lib Dems’ foghorn-like “stop Brexit” message than a later one, especially if Parliament passes a deal in the meantime. But even if that happens, it will only trigger a new debate over the country’s future relationship with Europe. As one Labour wonk admits, Brexit is now “an identity issue as much as a trade-relationship issue”. Lib Dems believe Brexit is not in the country’s interests. For now, it is in theirs.■\n"

      "A ago, on a rainy October evening, Asiyah Ravat staked out the father of a pupil who had gone off the rails. He was not at home when she visited. “So I just said, ‘We’re not going anywhere, we’re in the car,” recalls Mrs Ravat, the head at Eden Boys’ School, an Islamic state secondary in the suburbs of Birmingham. The meeting helped, and there was no more trouble. Last year the pupil achieved ten grade 9s, the highest score available, in his s. “I don’t see these boys as pupils,” says Mrs Ravat, “I see them as sons.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The school is part of Star Academies, a group of schools that help pupils make astonishing academic progress. According to the government’s key measure, which looks at development from age 11 to 16, pupils at Eden Boys’ make the second-most progress in the country. In results released on October 17th, only pupils at Tauheedul Islam Girls’ High School, also of Star Academies, made more progress. In third place was Eden Girls’ School Coventry, another member. Star schools also came 12th and 14th, and the chain comfortably tops tables comparing it to others (though few of its 28 schools have been open long enough to take s, meaning it is still early for such broad comparisons).\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the highest-performing schools on the measure have a traditional ethos, and this is true of Star Academies. “Although I don’t select the children, I say to parents, ‘I want to run a grammar school’,” explains Mrs Ravat. Only two boys have ever been kicked out, but rules are strict—pupils must walk on the left-hand side of the corridor and line up in silence before lessons. As she tours the school, Mrs Ravat pauses to place a ruler in front of a pupil who has not underlined his title. “We’ve got a presentation policy,” she shrugs. “They’ve got to adhere to it.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Star promises a “high-powered, knowledge-based academic curriculum”. Top sets at Eden Boys’ have as many as 30 children, whereas bottom ones can be as small as ten, so strugglers get most attention. Extra classes are put on after school and at weekends for those who need them. Annual Oxbridge visits raise the sights of pupils who come from an insular community (a surprising number fail to recognise a picture of the Bullring, a shopping centre in town, notes one teacher). Many grow up speaking Gujarati, Punjabi or Urdu—something which boosts the group’s results, since children without English as a first language tend to make more progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Non-white children also tend to do better in progress measures, notes Jon Andrews of the Education Policy Institute, a think-tank, making Star Academies’ next move intriguing. Last year the organisation changed its name (from the Tauheedul Education Trust) to reflect the fact that it has taken on nine non-religious, underperforming schools in parts of the country including Blackpool and Morecombe, both run-down coastal towns. Although many of the trust’s existing schools have no white British pupils, at some of the new ones nine in ten pupils are, and poor white pupils get some of the worst results in the country. The new schools are mixed-sex—as will be some other new non-faith schools the trust is soon to open.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite Star’s academic record, there was opposition to the takeover from parents in Blackpool, who started a petition objecting to it because of the organisation’s Islamic roots. In 2014 an undercover documentary showed a teaching assistant at one of the group’s primary schools describing music and clapping as “satanic”. But an immediate follow-up investigation by Ofsted, the schools inspectorate, found no evidence of broader hardline views or extremism. And the Department for Education has encouraged the chain’s subsequent expansion.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trust’s mission is to tackle social disadvantage, “which goes beyond faith,” says Kieran Larkin, the director of education. In truth, the bigger challenge may be introducing the chain’s culture into existing establishments. All academies opened by Star are rated “outstanding” by Ofsted. The new ones were doing so badly that they have been taken from the previous leadership. Hamid Patel, Star’s chief executive, is undeterred: “People have made excuses about these children—and written off their communities for too long,” he explains. “That has to change.” ■\n",
      "A in Wiltshire, British troops are engaged in a running battle—with their caterers. Meals at the base, served up by a French contractor, Sodexo, are so unpopular that soldiers have taken to buying George Foreman grills from a nearby Tesco supermarket. Yet once outed by their battalion quartermaster sergeant, often accompanied by Sodexo employees, these guerrilla chefs risk having their grills confiscated or disabled and being punished with show parade at night. “The army trusts me with a machinegun or a fucking tank, but they won’t let me cook my own food,” says one former squaddie, who served with 32 Regiment Royal Artillery for five years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain’s armed forces are struggling to keep the ranks filled. In July the services counted on 191,600 personnel, down from more than 220,000 in 2012. Three-fifths of those who left in the previous 12 months did so before their contracts had expired. Surveys of service personnel show that morale peaked in 2009, when 58% of “other ranks” (that is, not officers) were satisfied with service life. This year only 43% said the same.\n",
      "\n",
      "The chief reason for returning to civilian life is the difficulty of combining soldiering with family obligations. Many leavers also point to the availability of jobs outside the service—which was less of a lure ten years ago, in the aftermath of the financial crisis. But working conditions are a problem, too. In the past five years dissatisfaction with housing has risen. And only 29% are satisfied with the standard of catering, with non-officers especially grumpy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first skirmish came three years ago, when soldiers launched a vicious attack on the food on social media. “Because it’s the military they basically think we can’t touch them,” says one, “so it’s not like a normal restaurant where you can complain.” In the same year Sodexo strengthened its monopoly on food at Larkhill by replacing Katie’s Kitchen, a food van driven for 27 years by a local woman, Linda Clark, with its own van. “She had a knackered old camper van and we’d be working in the garages on tanks and she’d come round and sell you a bacon butty,” the 32 Regiment soldier reminisces. Even after a petition amassed 7,000 signatures, Katie’s Kitchen did not come back. Soldiers complain about prices, too.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sodexo provides catering and cleaning services at 31 army and air force bases in the south of England, and at six bases in Cyprus and the Falklands. “Retaining people used to a radically changing social environment is challenging,” says Mark Baker, a Sodexo director who says the grills were confiscated to ensure fire safety. He is now helping draw up plans with the army to create more relaxation areas inside barracks. As he points out, defence does not have a bottomless budget. But you can buy a lot of burgers for the price of a tank.■\n",

The leader of the House of Lords stood bearing the “cap of maintenance”, which looks a bit like a Santa hat, on a stick. The state opening of Parliament on October 14th, in which the government lays out its policy agenda, was much like any other, but for one exception.

But the main themes of the speech were Brexit, health and crime. By happy coincidence, these are also the top three responses when voters are asked what are the three biggest issues facing Britain, according to Ipsos . In short, a Conservative manifesto was outlined by the Crown.\n",

Some were rather smaller than billed: a proposed crackdown on people breaching deportation orders, for instance would result in about ten extra deportations per year, according to the Independent. But with an election expected soon, such details do not matter. Voters are more concerned about crime than at any point since 2011, when England suffered riots in its big cities.\n",

      "Law and order is home turf for the Conservatives. But they are now also picking fights on the National Health Service, normally a vulnerable point for the party. Mr Johnson rarely opens his mouth without a paean to the beloved but ailing . The Queen’s Speech contained a plan for a new body to investigate safety problems in the service. The Tories have already promised the another £20bn ($26bn) per year in real terms by 2024. This may pale in comparison to the once-in-a-generation spending spree that Labour launched under Tony Blair. Funding is still far lower than the trend line suggested before austerity began in 2010. But the Tories are hoping that years of straitened spending have lowered expectations when it comes to funding health care.\n",

      "The aim is to appeal to the people whom James Johnson, Downing Street’s head of polling under Theresa May, dubs “Conservative considerers”. These voters tend to be working class, female and northern. They voted Leave, but care more about public services than Brexit. The Conservatives courted them in the 2017 election, to no avail. In that year’s manifesto, aside from Brexit the Conservatives offered only a thin gruel of punishing reforms of things like social care and little in the way of extra spending. Now, the party paints policies in primary colours.\n",

      "S of the enduring truth of Benjamin Disraeli’s description of politics as a “greasy pole”. At first her ascent was smooth—a place on David Cameron’s “ -list” of candidates in 2006, a safe seat in 2010, a job in the Downing Street Policy Unit in 2013, a seat in the cabinet (as international development secretary) in 2016. But then came the great slide back down. On what she billed as a family holiday in Israel, she held unauthorised meetings with Israeli politicians, including Binyamin Netanyahu, and was summarily dismissed.\n",
      "\n",
      "In normal times Priti Patel might have spent the rest of her career in the army of blowhards with a great future behind them. In fact, Boris Johnson not only hauled her back into the cabinet in July but gave her one of the great offices of state, that of home secretary. Ms Patel will thus play a central role in carrying out the most important part of the government’s domestic agenda outlined in the Queen’s Speech on October 14th: more “bobbies on the beat”, more stop and search, more tasers and longer prison sentences.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the past few years the government has performed so dismally on law and order that it has ceded the initiative to, of all people, Jeremy Corbyn. Knife crime is spiralling. Last year a measly 5.5% of burglaries resulted in a charge. The thin blue line of the police has been stretched thinner than ever by a decade of austerity. Ms Patel’s job is to reverse that unexpected political calamity.\n",
      "\n",
      "Senior Conservatives believe she may also be a significant electoral asset. Ms Patel represents the beating heart of the new populist Tory party that is growing up alongside the old conservative version. Her parents are Gujaratis who fled Uganda shortly before Idi Amin’s takeover in 1971 and founded first one newsagent and then a chain of them. She was educated at a comprehensive school (it called itself a grammar school but was non-selective) and redbrick universities (Keele and Essex). Gujaratis are a classic commercial minority that combines a fierce entrepreneurial ethic with social conservatism. Ms Patel is no exception.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1995-97 she left the Tories to work for James Goldsmith’s Referendum Party as chief press officer. In 2012 she co-wrote a pamphlet, “Britannia Unchained”, which argued that “the British are among the worst idlers in the world” and said leaving the would allow Britain to become “Singapore-on-Thames”. (Two of her co-authors are now with her in the cabinet.) Ms Patel was one of the most vocal Leave campaigners in David Cameron’s government.\n",
      "\n",
      "Leading Tories think that she could do a lot to help win over working-class voters, whom they need to capture to make up for the exodus of liberal Tories over Brexit. Top of the list, of course, are Brexiteers. The Conservatives need to squeeze the Brexit Party’s vote down from its current share of 12% if they are to have any chance of securing a working majority. Ms Patel’s personal credibility with Leave voters is further burnished by the fact that her father once stood as a Independence Party councillor. Her no-nonsense views on crime—in 2011 she came out in favour of capital punishment, though she has since modified her position—is likely to go down well in the blue-collar constituencies and seaside towns that the Conservatives are desperate to gain.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tories’ list of target voters also includes socially conservative ethnic minorities. In the 2015 election the Conservatives got more than 1m votes from minorities. A post-election survey found that they enjoyed an eight-point advantage over Labour among Hindus and Sikhs. In 2017 lost ethnic-minority votes played a big role in denying the party a majority. Ms Patel is seen as the ideal emissary to aspirational minorities who want to build their own business, give their children a leg-up and fear crime and social breakdown. That a higher proportion of ethnic-minority voters voted for Brexit than for the Tories in 2017 only adds to her appeal.\n",
      "\n",
      "Can this self-described “massive Thatcherite” live up to expectations? Talking tough on crime is one thing; translating tough talk into effective policy quite another. It is easy to see the promised 20,000 new police officers buried in paperwork and other policies sandbagged by the courts. Being home secretary demands relentless attention to often mind-numbing detail.\n",
      "\n",
      "Roy Jenkins, one of the great reforming home secretaries, wrote that, at its best, the department’s hallmark was “meticulous and precise administration”. Peter Hennessy, a historian of Whitehall, describes the Home Office as a “precedent-laden, case-work-driven institution”. A mistake can easily blow up in the home secretary’s face—Ms Patel’s predecessor but one, Amber Rudd, was forced to resign over the Windrush scandal—as well as destroy ordinary people’s lives. But attention to detail and protocol is hardly Ms Patel’s forte, as her Israeli adventure suggests. A supporter politely says, “Her administrative personality is much less developed than her political personality.” A striking number of critical Tories describe her as “thick as mince”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Patel’s populist version of politics is also a double-edged sword. Many traditional Tory voters have had their loyalty tested almost to breaking-point by the party’s recent mix of establishment-bashing and incompetence. A few tub-thumping words designed to appeal to the hang-’em-and-flog-’em crowd, or a scandal involving lax administration in the Home Office, might break them completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "The normal rules of politics don’t seem to apply just now—in the past few months Mr Johnson’s poll numbers have ticked up even as he has piled defeat on defeat. Ms Patel’s hardline style might be just what is wanted when the public is fed up with the political class. Repeated reminders that she once supported capital punishment may prove a blessing in disguise. But putting this later-day Norman Tebbit in charge of the government’s central domestic agenda is one more dangerous bet for a prime minister who has already made more than his quota of such gambles. ■\n",
      "Editor’s note (October 19th): This article was updated after Boris Johnson sent a letter to Brussels requesting an extension of Britain’s date of departure from the EU.\n",
      "\n",
      "DECISION DAY became dither day. Rather than hold the expected “meaningful vote” on Boris Johnson’s proposed Brexit deal, on October 19th Britain’s House of Commons—sitting on a Saturday for the first time in 37 years—instead chose to wait a while. By 322 votes to 306, MPs backed an amendment proposed by Sir Oliver Letwin, an ex-Tory grandee, to “withhold” approval of the agreement until Parliament has passed the legislation needed to implement it.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Oliver intended his amendment as insurance against the possibility of Britain leaving the European Union without a deal on October 31st, the date by which Mr Johnson has said he will deliver Brexit, “do or die”. But his insurance policy has also blown Mr Johnson’s political strategy to smithereens. Under the so-called Benn act, the prime minister was obliged to send a letter to the EU by 11pm, asking for another extension. That he duly did—although he left the letter pointedly unsigned, and added another, saying that he saw no reason for a delay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson had two powerful weapons to help his bid to cobble together an alliance to win a meaningful vote, stretching from hard-line Eurosceptics to Labour MPs in Leave-voting districts. These were momentum and fear of a no-deal Brexit. The Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party’s refusal to support it was a blow. So was the Labour Party’s use of thumbscrews on its wavering MPs. Jon Lansman, a prominent left-wing activist, threatened that Labour’s National Executive Committee would replace those voting for Mr Johnson’s deal with “new socialist MPs”. Nevertheless, early on October 19th it looked as if Mr Johnson was within two or three votes of the 320 he needed. The desire in the country at large just to get Brexit done was palpable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Oliver’s amendment has not only destroyed this all-important momentum. It has also raised the hurdle over which the government has to jump. The amendment stops Parliament from voting on Mr Johnson’s deal until it has examined the legislation in detail. It potentially gives select committees a chance to do their nit-picking work. More important, it shifts the nature of the discussion from what is right with the bill to what it wrong with it. Before Saturday’s dramatic events Tony Blair had warned: “You don’t take a decision of destiny through a spasm of impatience.” The danger, for Brexiteers, is that you never take a decision of destiny without impatience.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson responded to defeat with his characteristic bluster. He promised that he would bring the necessary legislation forward for a vote on October 22nd. This would allow him to revive his my-way-or-the-highway strategy, replacing Super Saturday with Super Tuesday. He also repeated his promise that Britain would leave the EU on October 31st.\n",
      "\n",
      "It’s hard to see how any of this can work. Turning his hastily concocted deal into robust legislation will be a monumental task. The shift in mood from optimism to gloom on the government’s side on Saturday was palpable. Sir Oliver kindly said that, with his insurance against no-deal in place, he would campaign wholeheartedly for Mr Johnson’s deal and departure from the EU at the end of the month. This was cold comfort for a prime minister who that morning had been poised to achieve something remarkable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Where does this leave British politics? The simple answer is: as stuck as ever. The government has brought two different exit deals before the House of Commons in the past couple of years. Theresa May’s was defeated three times; now Mr Johnson’s has been thwarted. (In a speech supporting Mr Johnson, Mrs May confessed to “a distinct sense of déjà vu”.) Opinion in the Commons seems too fragmented for agreement on a deal with the current configuration of MPs. Parliamentary procedure provides too many levers for cunning MPs to use against the government. Ironically, the people with the most power to free Britain from this limbo are based in Brussels rather than London. EU leaders could simply refuse to offer an extension and force Westminster to choose. That is unlikely: though Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, and Emmanuel Macron, the president of France, played along with Mr Johnson’s “my deal or no deal” line, the EU has no desire to see Britain crash out without a deal. An extension will be forthcoming.\n",
      "\n",
      "Today’s debacle makes an election before Christmas more likely. The various opposition parties may be tempted to bring forward a vote of no confidence in the government and give Mr Johnson the public poll that he so desperately wants. What follows could be one of the most divisive elections in years. Mr Johnson will claim to be running against a hoity-toity political establishment that is determined to deny the people the Brexit they voted for. If he gains a majority, he should have the votes he needs to pass his Brexit deal. At the same time the debacle also raises the chances of a second referendum. The Labour Party has moved more decisively into the second-referendum camp and the number of MPs who think that another plebiscite is the only way to get Britain out of its current paralysis has increased. It was perhaps fitting that, while MPs debated, about a million pro-Remain protesters marched on Parliament Square, many of them festooned with EU flags that, until the Brexit referendum, were almost never seen on these shores.\n"

      "F of the 20th century, governments agreed on changes to electoral law with opposition parties, to calm fears of partisan gain. That is not quite how things work today. In the Queen’s Speech on October 14th, Boris Johnson’s government proposed a number of changes, including requiring voters to present photographic at the polls, to “protect the integrity of democracy”. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s leader, called the plans “clearly discriminatory”. Angela Eagle, a Labour , said they were no less than “an attempt by the Conservative Party to suppress voting, and…designed deliberately to hit the poorest hardest.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Demanding papers at the polls is common in countries with cards (which Britain does not have). Photo has also been required in Northern Ireland since 2002, to combat a situation where polling staff “were willing to turn a blind eye when half the inhabitants of the local cemetery turned up to cast their vote,” recalls Richard Mawrey, a former judge. But there is little evidence that in-person voter fraud is common in the rest of the United Kingdom. Thus Labour suspects the plans are designed to disenfranchise its supporters, who are twice as likely as Conservative voters to lack a driving licence. Under the plans, any voter without photo would be able to apply for a free “electoral identity document”. Yet how many would bother?\n",
      "\n",
      "In Northern Ireland, there was no sign of a fall in turnout when was required. Similarly, recent evidence from America suggests that, despite intense controversy, laws introducing identity checks have not reduced turnout among black voters. But a pilot in English local elections this year found, in two of the four wards with sufficient data, a correlation between the size of the Asian population and the number of people turned away. It is impossible to say whether this indicated fraudsters being thwarted or legitimate voters being disenfranchised, says Stuart Wilks-Heeg of the University of Liverpool. Another possible explanation is that turnout tends to be higher in Asian areas, which may be why a greater number of voters was rejected.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether or not the need for photo puts off legitimate voters, the reforms will probably fail to stamp out a bigger source of fraud: postal votes. In 2004 Labour candidates in Birmingham manipulated postal ballots in a case of “electoral fraud that would disgrace a banana republic”, as Mr Mawrey, then sitting as an election commissioner, put it. Rules have since been tightened a bit. And the government now wants to ban “campaigners” from handling postal votes, put in place a limit on the number that can be handed in by one person, and make people reapply for a postal vote every three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "But postal fraud will still be far from impossible. People have got used to the convenience of voting by mail, so there is little hope of returning to a system that allowed it only in special circumstances. As Eric Pickles, a Conservative peer who wrote a report on electoral fraud in 2016, notes: “Once the toothpaste is out of the tube, it’s very tough to get it back in.” ■\n",
      "H towering intellectual, a friend of the poor, a stickler for religious dogma and a hero, at least posthumously, of the gay-rights movement. With the canonisation on October 13th of Cardinal John Henry Newman (1801-1890), English Catholicism has acquired its first saint who lived any more recently than the 17th century. For tens of thousands of compatriots who have campaigned for his spiritual and intellectual gifts to be recognised, this was one of the sweetest moments since the Reformation, when England’s monarchy and ruling institutions broke with Rome and established a new church, leaving Catholics a somewhat embattled minority.\n",
      "\n",
      "As behoves an unusual cleric from an ever more diverse land, the ceremony in Rome was full of peculiarities. The British state was personified by Prince Charles, who would lose his entitlement to the throne, and hence his future status as ceremonial head of the Church of England, if he were to become a Catholic. The cardinal’s home town of Birmingham was represented by the lord mayor, Mohammed Azim, an adherent of the Muslim faith in which a plurality of the city’s youngsters are being raised. All that may be apt. During his lifetime, Newman won friends, as well as adversaries, in a wide variety of circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "“St John Newman pray for us,” tweeted Jacob Rees-Mogg, the fervently Catholic leader of the House of Commons and hardline Brexiteer, in response to the news. Meanwhile, Peter Tatchell, a campaigner for sexual freedom, said the church was guilty of homophobia in playing down Newman’s companionship with fellow Catholic convert, Ambrose St John. Mr Tatchell has described as “sacrilege” the church’s decision in 2008 to remove Newman’s remains from the two men’s common grave and place them in a more formal tomb. The church insists the pair’s relationship went no further than friendship.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whatever Newman would make of tinkering with his relics, he would probably have appreciated the diverse state of Catholicism in England. Since 1983 the share of people in Britain who call themselves Anglican has tumbled from 40% to 12%, while Catholics have slipped less drastically, from 10% to 7%. They have also done better at attracting people to church and retaining the young. About a quarter of British Catholics go to Mass most weeks. Peter Brierley, a religious statistician, says attendance in England ticked up last year.\n",
      "\n",
      "Behind these numbers lie huge contrasts. Strongholds created by Irish migration to the north of England are in decline, while Polish, Filipino and Latin American migrants join older residents to pack out the churches of London. “At least half a dozen Catholic churches in the London area attract thousands every weekend and they’d be [called] mega-churches if they were Protestant,” says Stephen Bullivant of St Mary’s University. “But there are churches in the formerly Irish bits of Liverpool that are emptying out and can’t find Catholic kids to fill their schools.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Cardinal Newman’s Victorian world might seem remote to England’s Catholic newcomers. But shrines and saints are something they relish. Catholics from southern India are now among the keenest venerators of the shrine of the Virgin Mary in Walsingham, an ancient English pilgrimage site. The tomb of England’s new saint, in Birmingham, will draw visitors from many places and persuasions. ■\n",
      "A than half of Britain’s undergraduates are women, just a third of those studying economics are female. Only physics, engineering and computing are more male. Boys are three times as likely as girls to do an economics -level. But dismal scientists are waking up to this dismal state of affairs. On October 15th the Royal Economic Society began Discover Economics, a campaign to widen the pipeline into the profession.\n",
      "\n",
      "An economist might first want to be convinced that the disparity does not simply reflect differences in girls’ and boys’ preferences. But there are good reasons to think that students make their choices with limited information. Sarah Smith, an academic at Bristol University and one of the founders of the campaign, says many schoolchildren think economics is narrower than it is. Most 15- to 17-year-olds, when asked, associate the subject with money. Economists have much in common with other social scientists. But whereas girls make up half to three-quarters of those studying geography and psychology, they shun economics. Nor can an aversion to numbers explain the problem: economics is even less popular among girls than maths.\n",
      "\n",
      "The subject’s lack of diversity might itself be off-putting. When Ali Norrish of Economy, a charity that seeks to make the subject more accessible, asks children to draw an economist, most sketch older men in suits. An economist attending the campaign’s launch recounted how his offer to speak to pupils at his old state-run school was rebuffed, because it would raise “unrealistic expectations”. Perhaps that explains why a quarter of privately educated boys study the subject, compared with 16% of all boys.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this means some young people are put off a career they might otherwise have found fulfilling—and which is relatively lucrative. Meanwhile the profession fails to attract the best talent, and the shedding of women and minorities at senior levels makes matters worse. That in turn narrows its appeal to students.\n",
      "\n",
      "Confronted with these market failures, economists are seeking to explain better what it is they do. A website will outline the breadth of the subject. Undergraduate “ambassadors” to schools will teach economics-related lessons. Economists from organisations such as the Bank of England and McKinsey, a consultancy, will visit schools in poor areas. Budging entrenched opinions won’t be easy. But this year’s unusually diverse set of Nobel prizewinners may help (see article). And, as economists know, more information should lead to better choices.■\n"

      "S mine shafts is hard, says Graham Clarke, operations director at Sirius Minerals, a company digging the first properly deep mine—a mile down—in Britain for over 40 years. At a certain depth, earth movement can cause trouble, or an aquifer needs sealing. One of Sirius’s shafts has descended 120 metres beneath the North York Moors on the way to a 260m-year-old, 2.69bn-tonne fertiliser deposit. Mr Clarke is surprised to have got so far. “Everyone said we would never get planning permission, then when we did they said we wouldn’t get our first funding.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The naysayers may yet win. Last month the -250-listed firm cancelled a $500m junk bond issue. It would have unlocked a $2.5bn loan from JPMorgan Chase, or enough in all to finish the £3.1bn ($4bn) project. Now Sirius could run out of money. Investors got spooked by market conditions, Brexit and the risks of shaft-sinking. Sirius also let it be known that the government in August refused a request to guarantee $1bn of bonds in 18 months’ time, even though state backing via export credit agencies is common in project finance.\n",
      "\n",
      "A challenge for Sirius, as well as the shafts, is getting its product, polyhalite, widely accepted by farmers. It is a speciality potash that is chloride-free (an advantage, since chlorine tolerance varies across crops). It has more nutrients that plants need than the two mainstream products, sulphate of potash and muriate of potash. Produced at scale, polyhalite has potential to disrupt the global fertiliser industry.\n",
      "\n",
      "That explains why existing powerful players, such as EuroChem, a Russian-owned giant with revenues of $5.6bn, have been talking down polyhalite, presumably adding to bond investors’ worries. Nevertheless, Sirius has struck multi-year sales agreements with customers to supply in total 13.8m tonnes a year at the peak. That will claim most of the mine’s initial production capacity. One is a ten-year deal announced on October 11th to supply polyhalite to Muntajat, a giant Qatari petrochemicals firm.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Sirius’s current funding—it has raised over £1.5bn—will run out by March. It has slowed operations; eventually it would have to fill in and cap its shafts and close off the mile that it has already dug of a 23-mile-long tunnel to carry the polyhalite to Teesside to be processed and shipped off as “Poly4” to fertiliser firms around the world. Never before has a mine been joined to a long tunnel—the design avoids unsightly railway tracks over the moors.\n",
      "\n",
      "At full capacity, Sirius’s positive impact on the local economy could be substantial. The company plans to ship £2.5bn-worth of polyhalite a year at full production and send an annual £470m to the exchequer. It employs 1,200, mostly local, workers and will need 2,800 more. In Teesside its tunnel cuts into the earth from an old site near shut-down steelworks; local politicians such as Ben Houchen, Tees Valley’s mayor, are backers. So are around 85,000 retail investors, many from Yorkshire and the north-east, who piled into Sirius shares over the past eight years. Many lost out when Sirius’s bond issue was cancelled.\n",
      "\n",
      "One reason the government declined to back the financing—in addition to its fears about the risk to the taxpayer—was that politicians reckon there are other funding options, say people close to the firm. Sirius is to come up with alternative plans by the end of the month. One option could be a strategic partner with a hefty balance-sheet. Given the push that the government has put behind boosting the north, it might not let the project fail. Even for believers in Sirius, however, the light at the end of the tunnel is getting hard to make out. ■\n",

That is not ideal, says Mr Rouse, who is 32. “When we were in Australia we lived by ourselves,” he says. When sharing, “you’re never quite grounded in your own space.” But ultimately the couple decided they had little choice. Their monthly rent and bills come to about 30% of their joint income.

Homeownership rates, which had been steadily falling, have stabilised since 2014. Yet there is a huge generational imbalance. Older people are occupying ever more space. Indeed, there is a boom in older people living on their own (see chart). For most younger people, however, affordable housing remains scarce. They crowd into shared flats in the most expensive parts of the country.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last year the number of people living alone crossed 8m. But the increase has been entirely among those aged over 45. Between 2008 and 2018 their number rose by 810,000, or 14%. The number under that age fell by 340,000, or 18%. Some 746,000 homes were overcrowded last year, meaning that there were not enough bedrooms for each single adult, couple or pair of children to have one to themselves. That was a 14% increase on a decade before. Meanwhile the number of homes that were underoccupied, meaning that they had at least two spare bedrooms, also increased, by 10%, to 8.6m.\n",

      "What is driving this? Some of it is simply growing life expectancy: people are most likely to live alone when they are in their twilight years. But divorce also plays a part. The number of marriages breaking up has fallen drastically in the past few decades, probably because fewer people are getting hitched in the first place. But the number of over-50s divorcing has increased sharply. Those newly single people need more space.\n",
      "\n",
      "And they can afford it. Britain’s tax system encourages people to “consume as much housing as they can afford”, says Rose Grayston of Shelter, a charity. Property taxes are lower, proportionately, on bigger houses. Stamp duty, a tax on buying property, can make downsizing expensive. Recently older buyers’ spending power has risen relative to that of younger people. In real terms, earnings have fallen since 2008 across the board, but most of all for the young. Rents have also fallen, but not by as much as interest rates or wages.\n",
      "\n",
      "One consequence of this is that more and more young adults live with their parents. A quarter of those aged 20-34 are still at home, up from around one-fifth a decade ago. But not everyone has a family to live with. And the poorest young people are particularly exposed. In the parts of London where it is legal, there is a booming business in converting offices into tiny bedsits cheap enough for people on housing benefit.

      "Nicola Sturgeon, the ’s leader and first minister of Scotland, was quick to condemn the Spanish court’s decision as “dreadful”. But the contrast between the two movements is stark. When it comes to radical activity, Scottish nationalists might engage in a boisterous march through the streets of Edinburgh or, if especially grumpy, wave some placards outside the “biased” . But they obey the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "This perhaps reflects the fact that Britain has been a union of choice for more than 300 years and has largely operated to Scotland’s advantage. Even with the separatist repeatedly elected to power at Holyrood, Scotland’s devolved parliament, over the past decade, the nation has remained a reasonably relaxed part of Britain, voting 55-45 to stay in an independence referendum in 2014.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is relaxed no longer. Polls in recent months have shown support for independence creeping up to 50% and above (see chart). One reason is Brexit, which Scots opposed 62-38 and whose implementation is proving to be messy. The other is the capture of Britain’s two main political parties by ideological ultras. Neither Boris Johnson’s Conservatives nor Jeremy Corbyn’s Labour holds much appeal. A growing number of Scots are drawing the conclusion that the union is broken and that an independent Scotland inside the would be preferable to staying in an English-dominated, Brexited Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "It may not be long before they are once again asked to make such a decision. Ms Sturgeon says she will request a Section 30 order from Westminster, enabling another referendum, by the end of this year. It seems unlikely that a Conservative government would oblige before the next Holyrood election in 2021. But should the Tories fail to win a majority in the general election that is expected soon, it may be that Labour is able to form a government with the support of the . The price of its support would be a second referendum.\n",
      "\n",
      "With their objective suddenly and unexpectedly looming into prospect again, some of the more excitable Scottish nationalists are growing impatient. In Aberdeen, the ’s leadership had to fight off an attempt by rebels to force the party to adopt a Plan for securing independence—for example, that it should treat winning a majority of Scottish seats at Westminster or Holyrood as a mandate to begin break-up negotiations.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Sturgeon’s critics say there is a sense of drift at the top. “Support for independence may be at 50%, but given the state of politics why isn’t it at 60%?” asks one prominent politician. “People don’t have a clear sense of what the strategy is,” says another. “The unhappiness is real and stronger than the leadership would like outsiders to believe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The first minister has long had to balance the ’s gradualists against its fundamentalists. The latter are often loyal to Alex Salmond, who led the party for most of the time between 1990 and 2014, and whose approach to politics was considerably more abrasive and divisive than Ms Sturgeon’s. There is also the matter of Mr Salmond’s trial, due early next year, for attempted rape and other sexual offences. No one is clear what the political consequences will be or what the voters will make of it; there is even talk that Ms Sturgeon herself could be forced to resign in the aftermath.\n",
      "\n",
      "Privately, strategists accept that the most likely—and, in fact, most desirable—route to independence is to win a majority in Holyrood in 2021. This, they know, would establish an undeniable mandate for a new referendum. Before then, they want to deepen support for leaving, and drive that 50% figure higher. “Our model isn’t the Brexit vote, it’s the devolution referendum in 1997 [which was won 74-26],” says a leadership source. “We want to make independence the ‘settled will’ of the Scottish people.” In her conference speech Ms Sturgeon promised that “we will win our independence, but not the Brexit way…We will win by inspiring and persuading.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the grumbles, gradualists still have the upper hand. They believe their lifelong goal of Scottish independence has never been closer, and that playing by the rules will get them across the line sooner rather than later. And the truth is that Ms Sturgeon, like all clever democrats, doesn’t want to have the fight until she is sure she can win it. ■\n"

      "BORIS JOHNSON was in ebullient mood when he spoke to the press in Brussels on the evening of October 17th, even talking eagerly of his dinner plans. But his main goal was to persuade those watching, especially in Westminster, that he had secured what he called “a great deal for our country and for the EU”. He has less than 48 hours to win over MPs, who are due to vote on the agreement on October 19th, in a rare Saturday sitting.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prime minister’s achievement is noteworthy, since many critics said he was bound to fail. He forced the European Union to reopen the withdrawal agreement it made with his predecessor, Theresa May. He struck a deal with Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, by talking to him in person. And he successfully ignored advice that the European Council would never endorse a last-minute deal by getting his fellow EU leaders to back an agreement reached only hours before their meeting. He even persuaded them to express hopes that the deal would be ratified in time for Brexit to happen on October 31st, a target he has repeatedly promised to hit, “do or die”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Mr Johnson got to this point chiefly by making concessions. He started out determined to scrap the notorious Irish backstop. This would have averted a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic by keeping the United Kingdom as a whole in a customs union with the EU. Mr Johnson’s alternative plan had envisioned keeping Northern Ireland within parts of the EU’s regulatory regime, eg, for agri-food and manufactured goods, but within a separate British customs zone. That was rejected by the EU on the grounds that it would have required some form of customs controls between north and south, despite Mr Johnson’s claim that these could be conducted unobtrusively away from the border.\n",
      "\n",
      "So Mr Johnson has now accepted the alternative notion of customs and regulatory controls between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, ie, in the Irish Sea. Although he insists that Northern Ireland will still legally be part of UK customs territory, the effect of this concession is to turn what was a backstop for the whole country into a form of frontstop for Northern Ireland alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson also gave up his attempt to give his political allies, the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), the right to decide every four years whether to stick to this agreement. The EU has conceded that keeping Northern Ireland permanently aligned on regulations and customs requires some form of political consent. But by giving this role to the Northern Ireland assembly as a whole, and not to unionists and nationalists voting separately, it has denied the DUP a veto power.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beyond the provisions for Northern Ireland, Mr Johnson’s withdrawal agreement is essentially the same as Mrs May’s. But his ambitions for the future relationship, enshrined in a new political declaration, are different. Mrs May’s deal pointed to a comprehensive free-trade deal based on close alignment with the EU’s single-market rules. Mr Johnson’s aims instead at a more basic free-trade deal similar to Canada’s. By erecting bigger trade and regulatory barriers with Britain’s biggest export market, this will increase the cost of Brexit. According to estimates this week from the UK in a Changing Europe, an academic think-tank, over ten years Mr Johnson’s deal will reduce British income per person by 6.4% compared with what it would otherwise be, whereas Mrs May’s would reduce it by 4.9%—a difference of £500 per head.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest question over Mr Johnson’s deal is whether he can get it ratified at home. He insisted in Brussels that he was “very confident” that MPs would vote for it. He is a better salesman than Mrs May, whose own Brexit deal was rejected by Parliament three times earlier this year. Yet the arithmetic is against Mr Johnson as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "It starts with the ten MPs from the DUP, who have come out against the deal because they object to a border in the Irish Sea and also to the EU’s consent mechanism. Their opposition may be echoed by some Tory hardliners from the European Research Group, who have taken their cue from the DUP in the past. Some of the 21 MPs who lost the Conservative whip after defying Mr Johnson by backing the Benn act, designed to prevent the no-deal Brexit that he had threatened to allow, may also vote against him. Even if both the hardliners and the whipless back Mr Johnson after all, he will still need the support of a dozen or so Labour MPs to win the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is possible he may get this, not least because many Labour MPs represent pro-Brexit constituencies. But Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, insists that Mr Johnson’s deal is worse than Mrs May’s because it could herald a weakening of labour, environmental and other standards. The party will whip its MPs to oppose Mr Johnson’s deal. Defying the whip to rescue a Tory prime minister when an election is looming is a challenge even for those Labour MPs keenest to get Brexit done.\n",
      "\n",
      "Downing Street will try to push MPs to vote for the deal by arguing that the only alternative is a no-deal Brexit. In Brussels there was some talk of getting the EU to refuse to extend the October 31st deadline. But in practice the Benn act is clear: if the deal is voted down in Parliament, Mr Johnson must ask the EU to agree to extend the Brexit deadline to January 31st. And EU leaders will not refuse such a request. So far in his short premiership Mr Johnson has lost all but one of the votes held in the House of Commons. Barring a miracle, he looks like losing again this weekend.\n",
      "I polls can trigger delight or despair, depending on which one its occupants look at. One pollster, Opinium, suggests the Conservatives are sitting on a handsome 15-point lead. Survation, a rival outfit, gives the Tories a lead of just three points, within the margin of error. Others are scattered between these extremes (see chart). The potential outcomes range from a hung parliament to a stonking Conservative majority. Someone is calling it badly wrong. Why has British politics become so hard to predict?\n",
      "\n",
      "For starters, voters are more politically promiscuous than they used to be. In the elections of 2010, 2015 and 2017, only half of voters supported the same party each time, according to the British Election Study, which has looked at every general election since 1964. About four out of ten voters switched parties in 2015. When the next election came in 2017, just two years later, one in three changed. By comparison, between 1964 and 1966 only 13% of voters did.\n",
      "\n",
      "When voters change their minds they often dabble with smaller parties, which makes things more unpredictable still. Voters see the likes of the Independence Party and the Greens as a fling, rather than the start of a long-term relationship. Between 2015 and 2017, 78% of voters defected. Among the Greens, nearly all did, with 88% of the party’s 2015 voters deserting it in 2017. Tracking these voters as they bounce around the political spectrum is a nightmare for pollsters. On top of this, new cleavages on everything from social liberalism to the future of the union to Brexit now compete with the traditional left-right economic divide.\n",
      "\n",
      "This newfound love of switching party is not taking place against a calm political backdrop. A series of electoral shocks has blown British politics off its steady course, explains Jane Green of Oxford University. First came a steep increase in immigration. Then the financial crisis. After that, Britain got its first coalition government since the second world war. Scotland had an independence referendum in 2014, before the Brexit referendum arrived in 2016. Voters are dazed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another shock may be coming. At the end of this month Britain could leave the European Union with a deal, fall out without one or, most likely, delay its exit yet again. This buffet of options provides another problem for pollsters. Asking people how they would vote after, say, a no-deal Brexit, or an extension granted after a case in the Supreme Court, is akin to asking someone what they will want for dinner in six weeks’ time. Their tastes may be the same, but the circumstances are close to unknowable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Asking people how they will vote in the future may be difficult, but so is trying to make them honest about who they backed in past. At the start of the 1990s, pollsters had to contend with “shy Tories”, people who would not admit to backing the Conservatives outside the privacy of the voting booth. Now they must deal with “shameful Labour”, people who say they did not vote for Jeremy Corbyn’s party in 2017, when in fact they did. To work out where voters are heading, pollsters need an idea of where they are coming from.\n",
      "\n",
      "A big range of results is not necessarily a bad thing. Few pollsters predicted David Cameron’s majority in 2015. Back then, the problem was one of “clustering”, with polling companies reluctant to be outliers. Now they are more ready to stand by their results, even at the risk of being wildly wrong. After all, “it isn’t science”, points out Kevin Cunningham, a pollster who lectures at Technological University Dublin. But it is more complicated than it used to be. Sir David Butler, the 94-year-old doyen of Britain’s pollsters, who studied every British election between 1945 and 2005, summed up the mess: “I have never felt more totally confused.” ■\n"

      "T that diplomats should enjoy protected status in their host country is an ancient one, and the consequences of violating the custom can be bloody. The Mongols destroyed whole cities in response to the mistreatment of their envoys. In Britain, Parliament passed an act preserving diplomats’ privileges in 1708, following a fuss over the arrest for debt of Russia’s man in London. The young United States passed a similar act in 1790. Today diplomats everywhere and their families are protected under a convention signed in Vienna in 1961.\n",

      "But immunity was not designed for the sort of incident that has now caused outrage in Britain and friction with its biggest ally. On August 27th a teenage motorcyclist, Harry Dunn, was killed in a collision with a Volvo near an American intelligence base in Northamptonshire. The car’s driver, Anne Sacoolas, who had reportedly arrived in Britain only recently with her diplomat husband and three children, was allegedly driving on the wrong side of the road. At first, it seems, she co-operated with police—but then fled the country with her family.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Dunn’s parents have been appealing for her to return so that their son’s death can be properly investigated. They say they are prepared to travel to Washington, , to make their case. The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has said he does “not think that it can be right to use the process of diplomatic immunity for this type of purpose”. President Donald Trump promised his government would “speak to [Ms Sacoolas] and see what we can come up with so there can be some healing.” But he accidentally flashed his briefing notes which read, “the spouse of the Government employee will not return to the United Kingdom”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dodgy uses of immunity—to avoid anything from parking fines to charges of sexual abuse—hit the headlines from time to time. Driving offences crop up quite often. And diplomats do not always get away with it. In 1997, for example, Americans were outraged when a Georgian diplomat claimed immunity after causing a pile-up in Washington that killed a 16-year-old girl. Georgia lifted his immunity and he was jailed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will British anger have any impact? America does not want to set a precedent. And it may want to keep a lid on the case if Ms Sacoolas’s husband was indeed a spy. Ms Sacoolas herself has reason to stay away: a possible prison sentence if she were convicted. Scarpering may be understandable, but it doesn’t stop the sense of injustice she leaves behind.\n",
      "O a flock of Thatcherites made their way to Banqueting House to celebrate the publication of the third and final volume of Charles Moore’s biography of the great prime minister. The heavens rained cats and dogs. Extinction Rebellion protesters blocked the Mall with makeshift encampments and drumming circles. Rumours of the failure of the latest round of Brexit negotiations filled the air. But nothing could deter our intrepid heroes from feasting on champagne and canapés.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boris Johnson was the most intrepid of the lot. He had to make the journey from Downing Street by underground tunnel to avoid being assaulted, verbally if not physically. He praised Mr Moore, his former boss, for displaying the lust for accuracy that is the mark of a great Daily Telegraph journalist. He praised Thatcher for being right about Europe. And he advised the pierced and tattooed “crusties” in the streets to buy the book and learn about the feminist and green warrior who changed the world for the better.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is no doubt that Mr Moore’s three-volume biography, 22 years in the making and almost 3,000 pages long, is one of the great political works of our time. Mr Moore has secured his position in perpetuity as the archbishop of Thatcherism. But whether the faith that he presides over survives as anything more than a set of empty incantations is more questionable.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thatcherism combined four elements: support for free enterprise; assertive nationalism; a commitment to strengthening the state by using quasi-market mechanisms to increase efficiency; and a belief in Victorian values, in the form of hard work and civic responsibility, which both tempered and underpinned the belief in enterprise. These four principles were accompanied by an establishment-bashing, “they don’t like us, we don’t care” attitude.\n",
      "\n",
      "This anti-establishment attitude remains strong. Some ultra-Brexiteer Tories are happy to damage both the Crown and the courts in their determination to take Britain out of the European Union. But what was once a coherent philosophy has decomposed into its component parts, many of which are decomposing in their turn. “Priti Patel”, the unimpressive home secretary, “is all we have left of a once-mighty intellectual movement,” jokes one minister, as he helps himself to another sliver of salmon sashimi.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of Thatcher’s ideas have become so mainstream that they are no longer distinctive. Using market mechanisms to improve the operation of the state has been adopted by so many different countries and parties that people forget its origins. Other ideas have become shop-soiled. In the wake of the financial crisis it is impossible to argue that deregulation is the answer to everything. Still others, like restoring Victorian values and creating a property-owning democracy, have failed. The proportion of people who own individual shares has halved since the early 1980s and among the young the rate of home-ownership has plunged. And some Thatcherite ideas have even backfired. Thatcher contributed to Britain’s problem of over-centralisation with her war on local government, and poisoned the well of privatisation by selling off natural monopolies in ways that favour investors over customers. In Tony Blair’s day, Thatcherites reconciled themselves to opposition by arguing that they had forced Labour to come to terms with capitalism. Today the Labour Party is run by people who spent the 1980s arguing that Michael Foot was insufficiently left-wing.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest problem with Thatcherism is that its two most important components—belief in free enterprise and belief in nationalism—are at war with each other. Thatcher was a nationalist who believed that the best way to reverse Britain’s decline was to unleash the spirit of enterprise. Freed from the burden of rules and regulations, entrepreneurs would restore Britain to its 19th-century glory. But a striking number of the businesses that took advantage of the free market were foreign. Britain is now the Wimbledon of global capitalism, more successful at hosting world-class players than producing them.\n",
      "\n",
      "The battle between business and nationalism is at its most intense with Brexit. Thatcher was the architect of the single market, which tilted the towards liberalism. But in her later years she became increasingly critical of the European project and fanned the flames of Euroscepticism, first with her Bruges speech of 1988 (when she warned of a “European superstate”) and then with a fusillade of behind-the-scenes interventions. The tension she stoked is now tearing the Tories apart. Some self-identified Thatcherites argue that the is the world’s biggest free-trade area and that a retreat to narrow-minded nationalism would be a disaster. Others say that the is a restraint on trade and that national sovereignty would allow Britain to be more global. And still others maintain that Britain needs to put up barriers in order to “take back control” of its destiny. Most big companies oppose Brexit. But some buccaneering capitalists are its biggest cheerleaders.\n",
      "\n",
      "The war over Thatcher’s legacy looks as if it will shift her party in a decidedly un-Thatcherite direction. Her Conservatives were all about dynamism and shaking Britain out of its comfortable ways by embracing risk. Some of that spirit remains with the Brexiteers. But to get Brexit done, the party is being forced to woo voters whose overriding desire is for security. The great theme of the recent Tory conference was providing reassurance—putting more bobbies on the beat, building more hospitals, raising the minimum wage and otherwise spraying money all over the place. The target voter is no longer the upwardly mobile striver but the left-behind northerner, and “get on your bike” has been replaced by “climb aboard your mobility scooter”. Thatcherism has not just decomposed. It is in danger of giving birth to its opposite. ■\n",

But the rest of the stadium is much smaller, and at two ends there are no stands at all, giving the ground a peculiarly lopsided feel. The concrete is chipped, parts of the stadium are rusting and the crowd is occasionally drowned out by a plane landing at the airport next door. A banner provides a reminder of better days: “Money can run out,” it proclaims, above black and white images of local heroes, “but legends last for ever.”\n",

Glentoran had been awaiting ministerial approval for a new £10m ($14m) stadium when the region’s devolved executive collapsed in January 2017. The stadium is one of a long list of projects—from a north-south electricity connection to the publication of gender pay-gap data—that have been put on hold in the absence of ministers. The executive was suspended after a precarious power-sharing arrangement between the Democratic Unionist Party ( ) and Sinn Fein fell through. Since then, various attempts to bridge the gap have failed, with the parties irreconcilable over issues including gay marriage, abortion and the Irish language. On October 6th the region reached 1,000 days without a government.\n",
      "\n",
      "When countries like Belgium and the Netherlands go without a government during coalition negotiations, they appoint a caretaker one, points out a recent report by the Institute for Government ( ), a London-based think-tank. The same is not true in Belfast. The lack of leadership comes at a sensitive time, with Northern Ireland the main sticking point in Brexit negotiations (see article). Cross-border institutions established under the Good Friday peace agreement in 1998 have been put out of action, impeding communication between Northern Ireland and the Republic, says Jess Sargeant of the . Meanwhile, the absence of a government in Northern Ireland has given the something of a monopoly over the debate in Westminster, she adds, since Sinn Fein s don’t take their seats on republican principle.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the Stormont Assembly not operating, no legislation has been passed. The British government has introduced new laws only when essential, such as for budgets. But Westminster’s backbenchers have not been as reticent. In July s hijacked a piece of procedural legislation to add amendments compelling Northern Ireland to allow same-sex marriage, begin to legalise abortion and to make payments to victims of the sectarian Troubles of 1968-98. These changes will be imposed if the devolved government is not restored by October 21st, which few expect to happen.\n",
      "\n",
      "Civil servants have had to be considerably less bold. Last year the Northern Irish high court overturned a plan to build an incinerator on the edge of Belfast, on the basis that a minister had already rejected the proposal, thus setting a limit on what bureaucrats could do in the absence of politicians. Afterwards, Westminster passed a law allowing Northern Irish government departments to make decisions in the “public interest” if they had to. But the civil service has not been able to act in areas where the public interest is unclear, such as raising tuition fees or increasing public-sector pay.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even where there is political consensus, change has been difficult to achieve. Outrage has been noisiest over the failure to respond to an inquiry into historical abuse in children’s homes, youth detention centres and other institutions. In 2017 the inquiry recommended offering compensation to victims, which has not happened. Unlike in England and Wales, legislation has not yet been passed to speed up criminal trials or to tighten the law on domestic abuse, despite the Northern Irish government’s stated intention to do both before it fell.\n",
      "\n",
      "Civil servants are acutely aware of the delicate role they must play. “A typical meeting with a politician, if I’m being absolutely frank, is them complaining about the things we’ve done and complaining about the things we haven’t done,” says one. In places where reforms had been set out by the executive before it collapsed, like those to reshape the health system, bureaucrats have some leeway. Most departments have no such luck, however.\n",
      "\n",
      "This is unfortunate in a region where public services are already in bad shape. According to the Nuffield Trust, another think-tank, a person in Northern Ireland is at least 48 times as likely as one in Wales to wait a year or more for health care. The education ministry has estimated there are 50,000 surplus school places in Northern Ireland, equivalent to a sixth of all places (closing schools is hard because of religious segregation). Infrastructure is poor and the economy relies on public-sector jobs. Even at the best of times, local officialdom does not seem up to the job, says Deirdre Heenan of Ulster University.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the absence of a government, it is difficult for the civil service to be held accountable unless someone takes it to court. The Northern Ireland Audit Office, a statutory watchdog, has continued to publish reports and senior officials have become more media-friendly (“It’s not the most comfortable thing in the world for a grey-suited civil servant,” admits one). But ministers cannot be asked questions, committees do not sit and Westminster has done little to keep tabs. With relatively little scrutiny of policies by outside institutions, this leaves a vacuum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sir Jonathan Phillips, a former head of the British government’s Northern Ireland Office, has said that leaving the European Union without a deal would probably require bringing back direct rule from Westminster, owing to the volume of decisions that would have to be taken. Few would welcome that. Yet there is little hope of a return to devolved government any time soon. Problems will continue to mount as the civil service struggles to keep things going, putting more strain on the Good Friday agreement that has stood for more than two decades. Not everyone is upset about the stagnation, however. The Oval is old and needs a lot of work, admits David Brownlee, a 53-year-old Glentoran fan, as he approaches the stadium before a Friday-night match against Cliftonville . “But I love the wee ground as it is.” ■\n",
      "M raise nearly £40bn ($49bn) a year, or about 5% of Britain’s total tax revenue. Nearly 70% of that comes from duty on fuel, levied partly to deter consumers from using too much of the stuff. Yet as drivers take the hint and switch to electric and hybrid vehicles, the government faces a problem in the form of falling tax revenues. Economists are therefore rethinking how to tax motoring in a low-emissions future.\n",
      "\n",
      "On October 8th the Institute for Fiscal Studies ( ), a think-tank, warned that over £33bn could all but disappear as cars become more fuel-efficient or go electric. Revenue from fuel duty has already dropped from 2.2% of in 2000 to 1.3% today (partly because duty has fallen in real terms). This decline is expected to continue as the government aims for “net zero” carbon emissions by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ministers could simply raise money by taxing other things, of course. But taxes are also a way of discouraging behaviour that imposes costs on society, and driving has plenty of these. Beyond emissions, they include accidents, noise and congestion. The latter is much the biggest, accounting for 80% of motoring’s total cost to society, according to the . Last year British drivers wasted an average of 178 hours in traffic, costing them £1,317 each in time that could have been spent on work or leisure.

Other places have come up with even more sophisticated ways to tax drivers. In Singapore they are charged for where and when they go, their movements tracked by a gadget fitted in their car. Cities in Sweden charge motorists for entering different zones, with fees varying depending on the time of day. As taxes on fuel dry up, expect more levies on congestion.\n"

One such place is Durham, where a 1,000-year-old place of worship towers over the narrow streets of a small university town.\n",
      "\n",
      "As one of the best-loved of England’s 42 Anglican cathedrals, it attracts not only the devout but history buffs, movie-goers (it has featured in the “Harry Potter” films and the “Avengers” series), fans of choral singing and Asian globetrotters who count the number of -protected heritage sites they have seen. A handful, including devout Catholics and Orthodox, come to venerate the remains of Saint Cuthbert and the Venerable Bede, the forefathers of English Christianity. But even in this fairly successful enterprise, maintaining the hallowed stone fabric is a perpetual struggle.\n",
      "\n",
      "Durham is not among the eight cathedrals that charge an entrance fee. But the 700,000 people who visit every year are urged, in multilingual signs, to make a contribution of at least £3 ($3.70). This year-old appeal has increased visitor offerings by a third. Well-informed and polyglot guides explain the cathedral’s history and drive home its need for money. But with a payroll of 131 full-time-equivalent staff, supported by 750 volunteers, and a creaking fabric to maintain, neither the contributions of visitors nor the amounts offered by worshippers are anything like enough to cover running costs. Nor can an exhibition of medieval treasures, costing £7.50 to view, or a shop or a café, fill the gap. Only by ever more ingenious devices, ranging from cultural and recreational events to corporate sponsorship and flashy appeals to fund specific repairs, are cathedrals managing to stay in business.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Tremlett, the dean of Durham cathedral, reckons his institution has kept the right balance between ancient dignity and 21st-century opportunism. When the “Avengers” film was being shot, the 350 people involved were required to fall silent several times a day when services were held. Whatever the disruption to worshippers, the filming enabled 150m people to enjoy footage of the ancient stonework.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other cathedrals have dreamed up even more eccentric ways to make use of the vast, numinous spaces under their control. An injunction by Archbishop Justin Welby, the head of the Anglican church, to “have fun in cathedrals” is being taken very literally. As a summer attraction, Rochester cathedral tucked a miniature golf course inside its soaring Norman arches. In Norwich, a helter-skelter was installed. This supposedly allowed visitors a closer look at a cleverly sculpted roof, but it was mainly a bit of entertainment, for grown-ups as well as children. Lichfield cathedral won higher marks for a light show entitled “Space, God, the Universe and Everything”, which involved transforming the entire floor into a lunar landscape.\n",
      "\n",
      "Through the eye of a needle\n",
      "\n",
      "Durham, like other ancient temples including Salisbury and Winchester, is ultimately saved by its handsome endowments, including property holdings whose value has ballooned. These rising asset values allow the cathedrals to run a deficit in their current spending. Durham’s accounts for the latest financial year, published this week, show that its unrestricted-funds account (that is, money that is not tied to a particular purpose) ran an “unsustainable” shortfall of nearly £1m. But net assets have risen from £66m to £76m, and clerical whimsy seems to be doing well. The cathedral restaurant wins praise for its “mouthwatering array of puddings”, prepared for a display of “divine desserts”.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all their ingenuity, about half the Anglican cathedrals are under serious financial strain, as was revealed by an inquiry prompted by an acute crisis at Peterborough cathedral in 2016, which led to a round of lay-offs and the resignation of the dean. As a general rule, the newer the cathedral, the worse its financial problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "One example is Guildford, south of London, a red-brick structure completed only in 1961. Being in a prosperous area is a mixed blessing, its masters find. A couple of years ago it came close to closure, after plans to sell off land for development were rejected by well-organised locals who feared the loss of green space.\n",
      "\n",
      "A new system of governance for cathedrals is likely to come into force next year, after winding its way through the Church of England’s decision-making process. It will aim to reduce the risk of financial disasters like the one at Peterborough, while allowing cathedrals to exploit their assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Charity Commission, which regulates most other non-profit bodies, will gain a share of responsibility for cathedrals. The bodies which advise deans, known as chapters, will be expanded to include more lay people with financial expertise. But the task of regulation will be shared with the Church Commissioners, a discreetly powerful agency which manages the Church of England’s assets and pays for some cathedral staff. On some matters the Church Commissioners are likely to take a broader view of a cathedral’s remit than the rule-bound Charity Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "The task, church insiders say, is to give free-ish rein to imaginative projects while curbing recklessness. As Mr Tremlett puts it, “The best cathedrals have been a story of excellence, innovation and creative learning, and we do not want a system of governance which quashes that.” ■\n",
      "N have been surprised when the European Union objected to Boris Johnson’s Brexit plan, proposed on October 2nd. After all, the proposal resiled from previous British promises that there would be no customs border between Northern Ireland and the south, and it also planned to hand the hardline Democratic Unionist Party a four-yearly right to veto the arrangement. Dublin was unhappy with the plan, as were Northern Irish public opinion and most business leaders. So what were the prime minister’s real goals?\n",
      "\n",
      "One may have been to stake out a tough position in hopes of luring a fed-up into a compromise closer to his terms. Yet unless Mr Johnson moves much further, this looks increasingly unlikely to work. Hence a second goal that became clear this week: to heap the blame for forcing a no-deal Brexit on intransigence in Brussels. A message to the Spectator magazine from a Downing Street source claimed that Leo Varadkar, the Irish taoiseach, had reneged on earlier promises to back the deal. This was followed by an implausible assertion that Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, had told Mr Johnson that any deal was now “essentially impossible”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The has been alert to such tactics ever since Mr Johnson became prime minister in July. On October 8th Donald Tusk, president of the European Council, demanded an end to “this stupid blame game”. The British government continues to insist that Brexit will happen on October 31st, “do or die”, and is even planning to mint 3m commemorative coins for the occasion. Yet the believes that Mr Johnson is now legally bound by the Benn act, passed by Parliament last month, to ask for an extension if, as expected, he gets no deal at the European Council summit on October 17th and 18th.\n",
      "\n",
      "Indeed, unless Mr Johnson gives a lot more ground, the summit is likely to devote most of its time to debate over another extension, not over a deal. Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group, a consultancy, reports that on this the mood around the is calm, not fretful. There is no serious talk of anyone blocking an extension, despite brazen threats in London that Britain will disrupt business and even limit future security co-operation if a delay is granted. The only issues are how long the extension should be and what justification to cite for giving it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The odds are that, as suggested by the Benn act, an extension will be offered until January 31st, though some are talking of March or even next summer. And the justification will be so that Britain can hold some democratic event—most likely the election that Mr Johnson badly wants, but, if not, conceivably another referendum. Downing Street has said it will summon s to Westminster for a rare Saturday sitting the day after the Brussels summit to debate future options.\n",
      "\n",
      "The knows that Mr Johnson wants to fight an election under the banner of “the people versus Parliament”, and perhaps even on a straight promise that, if he secures a majority, he will at once take Britain out with no deal. But by irredeemably splitting his Conservative Party, such a promise may prove impossible to keep. Eventually, Brussels expects Britain, whether or not still led by Mr Johnson, to have to come back to the negotiating table with a more accommodating approach. Hence its serenity in an otherwise chaotic week. ■\n"

      "E is back—and this time it’s political. The environmentalist group, which brought parts of central London to a halt for 11 days in April, has shifted its focus to 12 sites around Westminster, where its members began blockading thoroughfares on October 7th. With its makeshift buildings, meditation sessions and all-night dance marathons, the group has transformed Britain’s political centre. As dozens of mothers staged a mass “nurse in” with their babies on Whitehall, across town at Smithfield meat market a candlelit vigil was held for “all the animals who lost their lives”. Protesters plan to stay put for a fortnight.\n",
      "\n",
      "The police, who were caught off-guard in April, are this time better prepared. Some 580 arrests were made in just the first 48 hours, more than half the total made during the April rebellion. Over 80 tonnes of equipment have been seized. Grant Shapps, whose Department for Transport had protesters superglued to its doors, nonetheless complained that officers were just “standing around the edges”.\n",

      "They have their work cut out in policing what has become a formidably well organised protest group. Whereas the Occupy movement, a similar outfit, became bogged down in cumbersome “people’s assemblies”, Extinction Rebellion ( ) has adopted an approach called holacracy, a management theory developed in 2007 by Brian Robertson, an American software engineer. Holacracy claims to spread power across employees by ditching traditional management hierarchies in favour of semi-autonomous “circles”. In ’s case, this amounts to what are in effect franchises of the main brand, which plan and carry out their own protests, following a loose set of rules set out by the main group. “The majority of the protests that happen this week I won’t know about,” says Sam Knights, one of the group’s strategists.\n",
      "\n",
      "As well as making the group more nimble, this has helped it avoid the internal divisions that often hamper protest movements. It helps that does not ask its members for a joining fee. Funding comes from the likes of Radiohead, a rock band, and Aileen Getty, an oil heiress. claims to have spent £1m ($1.2m) on this fortnight’s protests alone.\n",
      "\n",
      "Holacracy or not, hierarchies persist. In July a report by Policy Exchange, a right-leaning think-tank, identified two powerful groups within , known as the Anchor Circle and the Rapid Response Team (the latter has apparently since been replaced by a Political Circle and Organisational Circle). The report claimed that people in these steering groups had beliefs “rooted in the political extremism of anarchism, eco-socialism and radical anti-capitalist environmentalism”, in contrast to the diverse views of ’s members.\n",

      "T punch allegedly thrown by a Conservative at his party’s conference in Manchester this week made headlines is a sign of how rare that sort of thing has become. Until the 19th century, parliamentarians were a rowdy bunch, challenging each other to duels over matters including the pronunciation of a Greek word, whether a window should be open or shut, and an insult to a dog. It is only since the dawn of the 20th century that physical fights among s have declined, in part because violence came to be associated less with aristocratic honour than with the lower classes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet just as the danger to s from each other, and from state authorities, began to recede, a growing threat emerged from another source: the people in whose name they governed. Between the 17th and 19th centuries, a quarter of all incidents of violence or threatened use of force against s involved members of the public. In the 20th century that jumped to nearly two-thirds. Over the past 19 years the proportion stands at three-quarters, according to data gathered by Eugene Wolfe, the author of “Dangerous Seats”, a new book on parliamentary violence in Britain (see chart). Until the 19th century it was typically angry mobs that set upon politicians. Since the 20th, violence has tended to come from individuals or organised groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first such campaign was organised by the suffragettes, who knocked politicians’ hats off, attacked them with whips and hatchets, and threw bricks into Downing Street. Measured by the number of attacks on parliamentarians, rather than by their severity, the suffragettes were more active even than Irish republicans.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two parallel trends contributed to the rise of these “outsider” attacks on s. The first was the rise of constituency surgeries, which exposed politicians to their electorate more frequently and intimately than in the past. The second was the use of violence as a tactic to attract media attention to a cause—what the suffragettes started, Fathers4Justice and other fringe groups have carried on. “The irony,” says Mr Wolfe, is that “people are less tolerant of violence than they used to be, but they make an exception for politicians.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of this has been relatively harmless: eggs, flour bombs, custard pies and chocolate éclairs are the weapons of choice, along with, more recently, milkshakes. By and large, politicians have taken it in their stride. “Obviously not one of my fans,” said Ed Miliband, then the leader of the opposition, after getting egged in 2012.\n",
      "\n",
      "That changed in 2016 after the murder of Jo Cox, a Labour , by a far-right fanatic, days before the Brexit referendum. Her killing caused politicians to rethink their approach to online threats. Opposition s have called on Boris Johnson, the prime minister, to stop using words such as “surrender” and “betrayal” in relation to Brexit, arguing that it puts them at risk. Mr Johnson has dismissed this as “humbug”.\n",

      "Women and ethnic minorities suffer “the lion’s share of the abuse”, Eric Hepburn, head of parliamentary security, has said. Social media have made it easier to send violent threats. “The amount of abuse has definitely gone up,” Adrian Usher of the Metropolitan Police told a parliamentary committee in April, adding that it was unclear whether there was more abuse in society at large, or a greater willingness to abuse s. The answer, if current trends are any indication, is probably both. ■\n",
      "I palazzo on the banks of the river Arno on September 26th, Ian Gardner unfolded a “half-yard” (46cm square) of serge to show his Italian hosts. Their predecessors, he told them, gave it its name: perpetuana. Woven from the wool of hardy sheep from the west of England, perpetuana was so called because of its almost endless durability.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Gardner, a retired fashion retailer, is Master of Exeter’s Incorporation of Weavers, Fullers and Shearmen, one of the last craft guilds outside London. With just weeks before Brexit and the loss of preferential trading terms between Britain and the European Union, Mr Gardner and a party of his members were in Florence to commemorate a pan-European trade in cloth that helped lay the foundations of Western civilisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting in the 15th century, galleys from Florence, having delivered embroidered cloth to Sluis on the Dutch coast, would dock at Southampton and Dartmouth to take on bales of wool and perpetuana. The cloth was further processed and embellished in Florence before re-embarcation for sale across Europe. The Florentines with whom the English traded had their own professional association, the Arte di Calimala, which was subsumed in the 18th century into the Camera di Commercio. Last week’s modest ceremony, one of several events to mark the 400th anniversary of the Exeter Incorporation’s royal charter, was held at the Camera’s headquarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "All sides benefited handsomely from the triangular wool trade. By the 18th century, Exeter was one of Britain’s richest cities. Among the many by-products of the trade was Barings Bank, brought down by a rogue trader only in 1995. In Florence the cloth trade helped enrich the Medici family and finance the Italian Renaissance, creating a link between the sample of beige cloth unfurled last week and the masterpieces hanging in the Uffizi gallery a few hundred metres away.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Incorporation’s activities today are largely ceremonial and charitable. Its members no longer have to be in the textiles business. Like other Britons, said its unofficial historian, Simon Whewell, they divide more or less evenly on Brexit. But Remainers seemed to be in the majority among those visiting Florence. “I think it’s a terrible mistake,” said Roger Persey, a farmer, as he stood with a glass of Italian wine at an open-air reception atop the Camera’s headquarters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Whewell called it “just bizarre”. But, taking the long view, he was moderately sanguine. “Over the centuries, we’ve been through plagues and wars yet trade has always found a way around barriers,” he said. “It’s a bit like water flowing downhill.”■\n"

      "T struggle within Western civilisation over who is a boy and who is a girl took another small twist in September with the leak of new guidelines for English and Welsh schools regarding transgender pupils. The draft rules, drawn up by the Equality and Human Rights Commission ( ), which enforces non-discrimination laws, are expected to be sent to schools this month. But after the Scottish government cancelled similar guidelines in June, activists in England have launched a campaign to halt the ’s new guidance, saying that it would put girls at risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "Under the new framework, schools would be advised and sometimes required to open up areas of school life that have until now been separated by sex to those who identify with that gender. So a male child who identifies as a girl could be allowed to use girls’ changing rooms, or be admitted to an all-girls school. The guidelines mean that, on school trips, trans pupils could lawfully be placed in a bedroom with a child of the opposite sex.\n",
      "\n",
      "Trans-rights groups say new, inclusive guidance is necessary. Stonewall, one such lobby, says it is “vital all schools take active steps to create inclusive environments for trans pupils.” Mermaids, a support group for transgender children, opposes any delay to the new guidelines: “Organisations have been working for years to build a constructive source of information on best practice for schools,” it says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet some women’s organisations argue that the new guidelines uphold trans people’s rights at the expense of those of girls. The legislation that the is bound to uphold is the Equality Act of 2010. Seven of the act’s “protected characteristics” apply in schools: sex, religion, sexual orientation, race, disability, pregnancy and gender reassignment. Schools must weigh up how any policy affects people in those groups—for instance, how building works affect the disabled, or how food in a cafeteria might suit Muslim or Jewish children.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nicola Williams of Fair Play for Women, a rights group, says that whereas transgender children’s interests are consistently protected in the ’s guidelines, the rights of girls are not given equal weight. “It must be made explicit that sex and gender identity are different,” she says. “It is especially important for girls to be able to recognise and name the male sex, otherwise the right to assert their boundaries is taken away.” If a girl feels uncomfortable that a male child who identifies as a girl is using the girls’ changing room, the new guidance says that the girl who feels awkward, not the trans child, should go and change elsewhere. “We need to be sympathetic to kids with gender dysphoria but without impinging on the rights of other children,” says Tanya Carter of the Safe Schools Alliance, another rights group. “There are horrendous safeguarding issues around these guidelines.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Another criticism concerns procedure. The said in 2017 that it would draw up new guidelines in partnership with two trans-rights groups. Yet organisations advocating for girls’ rights say there has been almost no consultation with them. “They only seem to be listening to the trans lobby groups,” says Ms Carter. The insists that it has consulted with women’s groups.\n",
      "\n",
      "The guidelines are due to be released amid a steep, unexplained increase in the number of children identifying as transgender. The Gender Identity Development Service ( ), the ’s only clinic for young transgender people, says the number of children referred there has risen more than 30-fold in the past decade, reaching 2,590 in 2018-19. Some were as young as three.\n",
      "\n",
      "Marcus Evans, a governor of the trust under which operates, resigned in February over concerns that its “affirmative” model, which the also espouses, can lead too quickly to the prescription of puberty blockers and cross-sex hormones. He wants the process to slow down. “A high number of kids with autism and mental-health issues, as well as kids who may just be gay, are now identifying as trans, as if they believe this identity will solve their difficulties,” he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parliament’s Women and Equalities committee published a report in July proposing that future guidance on sex and gender should be approved by s. The reiterates that the recently leaked guidelines were still in draft form. But critics are having none of it. Ms Carter warns: “This is complete regulatory capture.” ■\n",
      "T as improbable as Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader, and Sajid Javid, the chancellor, have been chewing over a row about race and impartiality at the . It began on September 25th when Naga Munchetty, a breakfast-show presenter, was rebuked by a tribunal for speaking on air of her fury at Donald Trump’s insistence that four non-white congresswomen should “go back” to where they came from. Tony Hall, the corporation’s director-general, defended the tribunal’s ruling, only to overturn it after five days of criticism. The affair was covered live, not least by the ’s own reporters.\n",
      "\n",
      "All British broadcasters are bound by rules on impartiality. But the in particular, funded as it is by a tax on viewers, is regarded as “public property”, says Sir Peter Bazalgette, an ex- man who is now chairman of , a commercial rival. This makes such disputes tricky territory for the corporation. Its 3,000-word impartiality guidelines distinguish between issues that are merely “controversial” and those that are “major matters”. “Advice on whether a subject is ‘controversial’ is available from Editorial Policy,” they state.\n",
      "\n",
      "It has not been impartial on every hot topic. John Ryley, now head of Sky News, remembers a grandee telling him, as a trainee at News in the late 1980s, that impartiality applied universally. Was the corporation therefore impartial on apartheid, he asked? “He said, ‘Of course we’re not.’ So things aren’t quite as binary as he suggested.” The rules do not require giving anti-Semites airtime. Nor need facts be “balanced” by those who do not believe them. Fran Unsworth, director of news, reminded staff last year that reports on climate change need not feature “deniers”, “in the same way you would not have someone denying that Manchester United won 2-0 last Saturday. The referee has spoken.”\n",
      "\n",
      "But the rules are clear that viewers should not be able to discern journalists’ views on political issues. John Simpson, a foreign correspondent, and Andrew Neil, a presenter, have got into hot water for sounding off on Twitter. Some journalists think Ms Munchetty’s remarks fell into this category. She appeared uncomfortable as her co-presenter, Dan Walker, prompted her to comment. “I’m not here to give my opinion,” she said, after doing just that.\n",
      "\n",
      "Others argue that racism is so beyond the pale that these rules do not apply. Sir Peter argues that, since society deems racism unacceptable, it must be acceptable for a presenter to say so. “This is a question of asserting public morality, not impartiality,” he says, “as it would be with child abuse, theft or terrorism.” The ’s initial ruling reflected both viewpoints, endorsing Ms Munchetty’s decision to say that Mr Trump’s phrase was “embedded in racism”, but criticising her for saying she was “absolutely furious” with the president.\n",
      "\n",
      "The spread of identity politics will make such decisions trickier. Some broadcasters reckon journalists’ “lived experience” adds insight to their reporting. One cites Frank Gardner, the ’s security correspondent, who spoke of his frustration over long waits on empty planes to be helped to the ground in his wheelchair. It is absurd, they argue, that a presenter can criticise racist language but not its speaker.\n",
      "\n",
      "In such circumstances, impartiality can seem robotic or even offensive. Yet editors will continue to defend it. “We have a lot of youngsters in our newsroom who see the world slightly differently,” says Mr Ryley, 57. “They say, ‘Why can’t we say this? It is what I believe.’ But I think you should be able to articulate that being impartial is good for the brand. By being impartial, people will trust us.” ■\n",
      "T , Britain’s tabloid newspapers have been revelling in the Duke and Duchess of Sussex’s ten-day tour of southern Africa, which came to an end on October 2nd. The flattering headlines—“Meg me smile”, “Royals Duchy Feely in Africa” and “Tutu cute for words” (after baby Archie high-fived Archbishop Desmond Tutu)—came thick and fast, alongside pictures of Meghan meeting young fans. “She stunned in a cream midi shirt dress and statement heels,” gushed a typical account.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the real stunner came from Prince Harry. The day before the tour’s end he launched an attack on the very same tabloids, accusing them of waging a “ruthless campaign” against Meghan that threatened to repeat the tragedy of his mother’s death. Princess Diana died in a car crash in 1997, aged 36, after being pursued by paparazzi. As for Meghan, “I have been a silent witness to her private suffering for too long,” Harry wrote.\n",
      "\n",
      "Royal-watchers agree that the couple have had a bad run of stories since their wedding last year. Being skewered over the £2.4m ($3m) of taxpayer funds spent renovating their house particularly rankled. But the timing of Harry’s statement, during their successful African tour, was unwise, says Dickie Arbiter, a former press secretary for the queen. It is thought that the statement took the press office at Buckingham Palace by surprise.\n",
      "\n",
      "First among the accused newspapers is the Mail on Sunday, which Meghan is suing for copyright infringement, misuse of private information and violating data-protection law. In February the 1.2m-circulation tabloid published excerpts from a handwritten letter to her estranged father, Thomas Markle. Her letter asked him to stop talking to the media. But the reason the missive was known about was that Meghan’s close friends had talked about it to People, an American celebrity magazine. Mr Markle then shared the letter with the Mail.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Sussexes might go all the way to court, and win. English law decrees that the author of a letter retains ownership of its content, regardless of who possesses the piece of paper. Harry also charges the Mail on Sunday with selecting from the missive to mislead readers. The paper says it stands by its story and that it will defend the case “vigorously”.\n",
      "\n",
      "What worries tabloids more than the copyright issue is that Meghan might win on privacy grounds. That would be important for all papers, “because every two-bob celebrity would use that to assert privacy rights against us,” says one newspaper editor. Britain has no clear privacy law, so precedent matters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not that the press is overly cowed by Harry’s broadside. Editors say the Sussexes are operating outside the royal tradition of “never complain, never explain”, and could be reined in. The case may end up being settled out of court. Meghan once played a paralegal in the courtroom drama “Suits”, quips one newspaper executive, “but does she want to appear on the stand in real life?”■\n"

      "Historically, women were more likely than men to vote Conservative. But under Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, Labour whittled away the Tories’ lead among women until it barely existed. It was David Cameron’s success in regaining a clear lead among women at the 2015 general election that helped the Conservatives to their only majority since 1992. Two years later this trend reversed, when Labour won the popular vote among women (but lost overall).\n",
      "\n",
      "Some Tories are unbothered. One hails the Conservatives’ new image as “the macho party”. At the party’s conference this week, where Mr Johnson went down a storm with members, the most notable demographic gap was not age but gender. Whereas the number of young men strolling around in smart blue suits felt higher than in previous years, there was still a dearth of women. In a typical fringe event, bald blokes outnumbered women.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Tories have some cause to be bullish. Women may mistrust Mr Johnson, but they still prefer him to Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s leader. Mr Johnson has a 25-point lead over Mr Corbyn when men are asked to pick who they would prefer as prime minister, according to Opinium. With women, the lead drops to a still-comfortable 18.\n",
      "\n",
      "Women tend to favour higher public spending, particularly on health and education, whereas men are more moved by promises of tax cuts, according to Ms Campbell. Given the government’s recent expensive promises, the Tories may yet win over wavering women. But the run of scandals around the prime minister will make that task harder. ■\n",
      "T who this week fulfilled his lifelong dream of addressing the Conservative Party’s annual conference as prime minister is routinely compared to Donald Trump. They both have crazy hair. They were both born in New York. They both have the ability to send their supporters into paroxysms of delight. But a more intriguing comparison is with the original architect of the Republican Party’s populist turn, Richard Nixon.\n",
      "\n",
      "This might sound far-fetched. In terms of personality, the two men could hardly be more different. Nixon was a pessimist who liked to brood alone with a bottle of whisky, whereas Mr Johnson is a gregarious optimist. Yet when it comes to their wider political personalities and strategies, the similarities are striking.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nixon is remembered today as a hardline conservative. He made his reputation as a communist-baiting member of the House un-American Activities Committee and destroyed his reputation as president with the Watergate burglaries and the White House tapes of his ranting against the elites. Yet for much of the time he governed as a liberal. He pioneered a wide range of liberal policies: affirmative action, with the Philadelphia Plan; environmentalism, with the Clean Air Act; and workplace regulation, with the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. He chose as his chief adviser on domestic policy Daniel Patrick Moynihan, a lion of liberalism. Perhaps most importantly of all, he opened diplomatic relations with China.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nixon’s great aim was to fuse conservative and liberal themes, to produce a new governing philosophy. Combine the Democrats’ commitment to big government with the Republicans’ belief in traditional values—and throw in a bit of demagoguery—and he would be invincible. A seminal moment in his intellectual evolution came when Moynihan encouraged him to read Robert Blake’s biography of Disraeli and he came to the conclusion that “Tory men with liberal policies” held the key to progress.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson represents the same confusion of reactionary and liberal impulses. His journalism is full of dogwhistles about Muslims’ “letterbox” burqas and the like. A Downing Street spokesman has accused prominent Remainers of “colluding” with the European Union. Yet Mr Johnson was also a popular mayor of Britain’s most liberal city, who supported gay rights and amnesty for illegal immigrants. He continues to regard himself as a liberal globalist who opposes the because it is a protectionist trading bloc.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson tries to reconcile these tensions by supporting a combination of big government and old-fashioned patriotism. His mantra is that Britain needs to “get Brexit done” so that it can turn to the real work of lavishing money on hospitals, schools and the police. In private he justifies his bulldog stance as the only thing that can save Britain from a nativist backlash if Brexit does not happen, or a far-left Labour government if austerity is maintained.\n",
      "\n",
      "When it came to putting his philosophy into practice, Nixon was dragged relentlessly to the right. He pursued a “Southern strategy” of recruiting into the Republican fold Southern whites who had voted Democrat since the civil war but were alienated by Lyndon Johnson’s Civil Rights Act. This was part of a wider national strategy of recruiting members of the “great silent majority”, alienated by those “limousine liberals” who were soft on crime and friendly with foreign powers. He surrounded himself with hardmen who understood that making omelettes meant breaking eggs. He foamed with contempt for establishment types such as businessmen (“those farts”) and university professors (“those assholes”), and unleashed his vice-president, Spiro Agnew, to denounce the “nattering nabobs of negativism”. He lived in fear that he would be outmanoeuvred on the right by George Wallace, who preached a purer version of his anti-establishment backlash.\n",
      "\n",
      "The same is happening with Mr Johnson. He intends to pursue a northern strategy in the next election, targeting pro-Brexit seats in the historically Labour-voting Midlands and north, to make up for the loss of pro-Remain seats in Scotland and the south-east. This is part of a wider national strategy of appealing to voters who are tired of being condescended to by metropolitan elites. He has deployed inflammatory rhetoric about Parliament’s “Surrender Act” to stop a no-deal Brexit. He has surrounded himself with hardmen such as his chief adviser, Dominic Cummings, who seems willing to do whatever it takes to make Brexit happen, and Sir Lynton Crosby, a master of the political dark arts. His establishment-bashing has extended to normally pro-Tory groups such as company bosses (“fuck business”) and even to the institution of Parliament itself. Completing the Nixon analogy, Mr Johnson has his own George Wallace to worry about in the shape of Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nixon’s strategy destroyed the man himself but revolutionised his party. By the early 2000s the Republicans were a big-government party with a Southern president, George W. Bush, and a Southern House majority leader, Tom DeLay. In 2016 Mr Trump won the presidency with votes from the Republican South and from blue-collar workers in swing states. The fate of Mr Johnson and his Nixon-like strategy is still to be written. He may be the shortest-serving prime minister in history. There is even talk of prosecuting him. The northern strategy will be harder to pull off than the Southern strategy: Mr Johnson is an Eton-educated Tory trying to appeal to working-class voters, whereas Nixon was a self-made Californian; the north is scarred by its industrial past whereas the sunbelt was rising. But if he can pull off a remarkable election victory by offering certainty—or the illusion of certainty—while his opponents offer dither and delay, the result would be a long-term change in the nature of the Conservative Party, just as far-reaching as the one that Nixon began in the Republicans. Then Britain really would be in with a chance of producing its own Donald Trump. ■\n"

      "F the European Union has complained that, even as the October 31st deadline for Britain to leave drew nearer, Boris Johnson’s new government was failing to offer clear proposals to amend Theresa May’s failed Brexit deal. All Mr Johnson would say was that the hated backstop, an arrangement to avert a hard border in Ireland by keeping the United Kingdom in a customs union, had to go. This week, after a tub-thumping party conference speech in Manchester under the slogan “Get Brexit done”, Mr Johnson at last put forward his plan. Yet despite his labelling it a “fair and reasonable compromise”, it got a cool reception from the , which sees it as a breach of promises, not the basis for a new deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "As expected, Mr Johnson’s proposal would keep Northern Ireland under the ’s agri-food regulatory regime. He now wants to expand this to cover manufactured goods as well. But Great Britain would opt out of the rules, implying checks on goods moving between Northern Ireland and the mainland. And the plan would apply for only four years after the transition period ends in 2021, at which point the Northern Irish Assembly would decide whether to remain aligned with the or adopt British rules. Meanwhile, the whole would leave the customs union. This implies customs checks between Northern Ireland and the south—though Mr Johnson insists these could be automated and, when necessary, conducted away from the border. He also wants Northern Ireland out of the ’s value-added-tax regime.\n",
      "\n",
      "The plan was welcomed by Tory Brexiteers and, more importantly, by the Northern Irish Democratic Unionist Party, which supports the Tories in Parliament. Yet it has little appeal in Brussels or, critically, Dublin. governments see it as a big step back from undertakings given by Mrs May in December 2017 to maintain an open, frictionless border in Ireland, preserve the all-island economy and avoid new customs or border controls anywhere on the island. They are unhappy about the proposed unilateral four-year time limit. And they do not believe that promises to use new technology, exemptions for small businesses and a system of trusted traders would be enough to avoid physical controls at or near the border.\n",
      "\n",
      "British ministers were out in force this week selling the new plan as what one called a “landing zone” that could satisfy all sides. Mr Johnson suggested that, just as he had compromised, so it was now the ’s turn. Some in Brussels were relieved that he had not said it was his final, “take it or leave it” offer, as initial reports had suggested. A few even hoped it might be tweaked to include alignment on customs as well as on regulations, or to revert to a Northern Ireland-only backstop. Yet the signals from Downing Street suggest that the prime minister sees little scope for more compromise on his side.\n",
      "\n",
      "His sales pitch to the ahead of the crucial European Council summit on October 17th-18th rests on two arguments. The first is that only a deal close to his can ever pass in Parliament. For evidence, he cites the Brady amendment, a version of Mrs May’s Brexit deal minus the backstop, which s voted for in January. The second is that, if the is unwilling to accept his plan, he will have no alternative but to leave with no deal on October 31st. And although that may be bad for Britain, it will also hurt the , especially Ireland.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in Brussels neither argument seems convincing. The knows that Mr Johnson has no parliamentary majority. He cannot rely even on his own Tory s, since some hardliners prefer no-deal to anything else. This means he needs at least some Labour backing to pass any deal. And although there are Labour s who share the Tories’ desire to “get Brexit done”, and many are nervous about no-deal, few will want to rescue a prime minister whom they mistrust as a populist popinjay.\n",
      "\n",
      "As for no-deal, everyone is aware of Mr Johnson’s repeated promises to take Britain out of the on October 31st, “do or die”. His ministers loyally repeated this pledge in Manchester. Mr Johnson himself argued forcefully against any further dither or delay. Yet Brussels also understands the terms of the Benn act that was passed by Parliament last month. This requires the prime minister to seek the agreement of the to a three-month extension of the deadline if, by October 19th, he has neither secured a deal nor won parliamentary approval for a no-deal Brexit.\n",
      "\n",
      "January is the new October\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson says he will obey the law, but he also insists that Britain will leave the on October 31st, whatever happens. These two positions are clearly in conflict. Hence a favourite parlour game at the Tory conference: to hunt for loopholes in what Mr Johnson likes to call the “Surrender Act”. Some suggest he might formally ask for an extension but secretly tell Brussels he does not want one. Or he could invite other governments to refuse an extension, so as to exert more pressure on s to accept a deal. He might invoke an emergency under the Civil Contingencies Act, to suspend the law. Some ministers claimed there was a secret wheeze to get round the Benn act, but that it was confidential.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet one of the act’s authors, Dominic Grieve, a former Tory attorney-general, insists its drafting is legally watertight. He characterises the suggested tricks to try to get round it as “far-fetched and reputationally catastrophic”. He and his supporters, who have a majority in Parliament, are ready to legislate again if need be. They would go to court at the slightest hint that Mr Johnson might flout their law. Some even talk of passing a “humble address” to invite the queen to sack her prime minister in such circumstances.\n",
      "\n",
      "Any extension of the October 31st deadline would be a humiliation for Mr Johnson, which is why some suggest he should resign instead. Yet there could be ways to turn matters to his advantage. One idea is to attach a confirmatory referendum to some version of a Brexit deal, which might win over a majority of s. But the prime minister is averse to the notion of a second vote. He would prefer a general election which, after being forced against his will to request an extension, he could fight under the banner of backing the people who voted to leave the against an establishment determined to stand in their way.\n",
      "\n",
      "The obstacle to this is the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act. This requires a two-thirds majority of s to vote in favour of any early dissolution of Parliament. The effect has been to give the Labour opposition a veto over the prime minister’s repeated calls for an early general election. The irony that it was a Conservative-led government, under David Cameron, that passed this particular piece of legislation is surely not lost on Mr Johnson. ■\n",

The Labour Party’s annual get-together, held in a rainy Brighton on September 21th-24th, was brought to a premature end by the Supreme Court decision that the government’s prorogation of Parliament was unlawful. Jeremy Corbyn gave his leader’s speech a day early and returned to Parliament in order to grill the government.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservative Party conference, which is being held in Manchester between September 29th and October 2nd, is likely to be a shadow of its normal self. A Parliament that is seething at Boris Johnson’s proroguing ploy voted by a majority of 306 to 289 against granting the Tories a recess for their conference. This means that Conservative MPs, and particularly government ministers, will have to shuttle back to Westminster to deal with parliamentary business and to try to prevent Mr Corbyn’s promised attempts to strengthen the barriers against Britain leaving the European Union with no deal on October 31st.\n",
      "\n",
      "The conference drama plays out against a background of extraordinary turbulence in British politics. Both the government and the opposition have lost control of events. Parliament has degenerated into a bear pit. The party structure is fragmenting, with One Nation Tories leaving the Conservative Party, social democrats leaving the Labour Party and the Liberal Democrats strengthening. Conservative populists warn that there will be riots on the streets if Britain doesn’t leave the EU on time, whereas Labour populists argue that democratic politics needs to take place on the streets and in the factories rather than just in Parliament.\n",
      "\n",
      "Two men are at the heart of this disturbing radical shift: the party leaders’ right-hand men, Seumas Milne (pictured, left) and Dominic Cummings (right). Mr Milne has been working as Mr Corbyn’s chief strategist since the latter became leader in September 2015. Mr Cummings has been Mr Johnson’s special political adviser since he arrived in Downing Street in July. The two have a striking amount in common. Both have spent their lives hanging around the fringes of power preparing for this moment—Mr Milne as a long-time journalist with the Guardian (and, long ago, for a short time with The Economist) and Mr Cummings as a Conservative special adviser and leader of the Vote Leave campaign. And they are both revolutionaries who despise the British establishment and believe that the country needs to be turned upside down.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Milne is the more conventional of the two, as an establishment-hating member of the British establishment. He is part of a long line of British radicals who have lived in the bosom of the British ruling class—his father was director-general of the BBC and he was educated at Winchester and Balliol before working on Fleet Street—while denouncing the establishment for every sin under the sun. His views are equally old-hat: whatever the establishment is for, he is against it. He is against American imperialism and EU expansionism, against neo-liberalism and free-market fundamentalism and, perhaps above all, he is against Zionism. As an undergraduate he was so committed to the Palestinian cause that he spoke with a Palestinian accent and called himself Shams, Arabic for sun. Kremlinologists of British politics detect Mr Milne’s influence in some of Mr Corbyn’s most toxic policies: his refusal to pin the blame for the Salisbury poisonings on the Russians, his stonewalling over investigating anti-Semitism and his foot-dragging over a second referendum.\n",
      "\n",
      "The striking thing about Mr Milne is not what he thinks but where he is. The Labour Party has historically been intolerant of the far left. The government of Clement Attlee sided vigorously with America after the second world war. Neil Kinnock fought a long battle to keep the far left on the margins of the party. Mr Milne has been able to burrow into the heart of the Labour beast because of two unexpected developments. Margaret Thatcher’s trade union reforms weakened the power of the private-sector trade unions, which had acted as a constraint on the hard left, while simultaneously radicalising the public-sector trade unions. The destruction of Blairism by the twin disasters of the Iraq war and the global financial crisis created an appetite for “real socialism”.\n",
      "\n",
      "In some ways Mr Cummings is Mr Milne in reverse. Whereas Mr Milne was born into the establishment, Mr Cummings is an example of upward mobility. He grew up in the north, the son of an oil-rig manager, but married the only daughter of Sir Humphry Wakefield, who owns Chillingham Castle in Northumberland. Whereas Mr Milne is always impeccably dressed in a suit and tie, Mr Cummings dresses down in a sleeveless jacket and trainers. And whereas Mr Milne is quietly spoken, Mr Cummings is given to expletive-laden rants.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Cummings is also much more of an original thinker than Mr Milne. He has constructed his own idiosyncratic philosophy, whereas Mr Milne serves up neo-Marxist pap. A reading of Mr Cummings’ lengthy blog-posts reveals a restless mind grappling with a whirlwind of change. One moment he is meditating on whether artificial intelligence will produce a high-tech millennium. The next he is praising Singapore’s education system. The next he is spinning out ideas about a British space programme.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor are these mere words. Mr Cummings has shaken up every institution he has been part of. As Michael Gove’s special adviser at the Department for Education, he waged war on the establishment “blob”. As head of Vote Leave, he sidelined old-time Brexiteers such as Sir William Cash and mounted a campaign based on mastery of new media and old-style populism. As Mr Johnson’s chief strategist, he has turned politics upside down by forcing people who don’t share his commitment to making Brexit happen on October 31st either out of power or out of the Tory party. David Cameron called him a “career psychopath” and, in 2014, banned him from working as a special adviser again.\n",
      "\n",
      "How Mr Cummings made it to the heart of the Conservative Party is a far more intriguing question than how his fellow revolutionary made it to Labour’s. After all, the Conservative Party is supposed to be about conserving things rather than smashing them up. The obvious answer—as with everything about British politics these days—is Brexit. Mr Cummings has reassembled his Brexit machine in the heart of Downing Street. The Tories have reconciled themselves to a series of rolling disasters since “Dom” took over, notably the loss of 21 MPs, on the grounds that Mr Cummings pulled off the impossible by winning the Brexit referendum.\n",
      "\n",
      "But there is another answer: the cult of disruption has gripped the Conservative Party. The party was arguably programmed to embrace the cult by Thatcher’s assault on the post-war consensus. But Silicon Valley’s enthusiasm for “moving fast and breaking things” has given Thatcherite radicalism a new lease of life and a new high-tech gloss. Mr Cummings is particularly adept at playing disruptive tunes. He presents both the EU and the Whitehall bureaucracy as cartels bent on resisting change; he sings the praises of innovation, entrepreneurship and “creative destruction”; and, in his own mind at least, he sides with the technology-enhanced future against the technology-suppressing past.\n",
      "\n",
      "Love of capitalist disruption springs from the same psychological roots as hard-left radicalism: contempt for both the past and compromise, and belief in technology-driven change. Capitalist disruption and hard-left radicalism also feed on each other. The more the Tory party embraces Mr Cumming’s unfamiliar brand of politics, the more likely it is that Mr Milne will get a chance to implement his more familiar brand of radicalism.\n"

      "W the air of a nightclub on the Brighton seafront as John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, walked on stage on September 22nd. The compères of the Radical Variety Show, a side event at Labour’s annual conference, had a surprise for the man who will be in charge of the world’s sixth-largest economy if Labour wins the next election. “Please may I introduce to you, the wheel of public ownership!” one cried. Out came an assistant carrying a Wheel of Fortune-style spinner. On it was a host of things Labour could nationalise: Systems (a defence company); banks; Greggs (a bakery); Heathrow airport. Chuckling, Mr McDonnell gave it a twirl.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour’s conference was a mix of radical policy, fights about Brexit and internecine civil war. With the party trailing in the polls and at war with itself once again, s and activists moped from stall to stall. Things got off to a bad start when left-wingers on Labour’s ruling National Executive Committee launched a botched bureaucratic assassination attempt against Tom Watson, the party’s deputy leader. “It’s the hitman who missed!” shouted Mr Watson at Jon Lansman, the Labour activist who oversaw the attempt, when they bumped into each other.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour sorted out its Brexit position, but not without a fight. Delegates at the conference, which sets party policy, narrowly decided that Labour would not campaign to stay in the at the next election. Instead it would support a second referendum, with a viable Leave option set against remaining in the union. Although nearly all its s, the vast majority of its members and the bulk of its voters support staying in the , about a third of its voters at the last election backed Leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "Since 2017, when Labour promised a hard Brexit, taking Britain out of the single market and customs union and ending the free movement of Labour, the party has softened its stance. At last year’s conference, the mere suggestion of a second vote with Remain on the ballot by Sir Keir Starmer, the shadow Brexit secretary, triggered an enormous row. Now it is party policy (albeit after another enormous row). A motion calling for free movement to continue after Brexit was also passed. The result is that, in two years, Labour’s Brexit policy has undergone a slow revolution. Nonetheless, many Remainers are cross that the party will go into the next election without a position on how it would campaign in any referendum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bureaucratic battles and Brexit almost overshadowed the most radical policy platform put forward by any British political leader since Margaret Thatcher. A target to make Britain carbon-neutral by 2030 was agreed on, even though some union bosses gritted their teeth at the idea. Pharmaceutical companies that tried to gouge patients would have their patents snatched, said Mr Corbyn. Mr McDonnell promised a 32-hour (four-day) working week within a decade—much sooner than the end-of-century deadline proposed by trade unions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Spending commitments piled up. Labour would dish out 2.5m interest-free loans of up to £33,000 ($40,700) for people to buy an electric car, at a cost of just under £4bn in lost interest. A “People’s Zipcar” was also floated, with Labour promising to introduce a network of pay-as-you-go electric cars across the country. Another £6bn per year would be spent on personal care for the elderly. A scheme to abolish private schools would cost about £4bn per year, if all the pupils were put in state schools. Mr McDonnell casually dropped in a pledge to end in-work poverty within the first term of a Labour government, implying a large rise in in-work benefits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Whether Labour will have a chance to enact these radical policies is another matter. Mr Corbyn is preposterously unpopular (see chart). Self-inflicted blows left a miserable mood at the conference, which contrasted sharply with previous years. The event in 2017, coming after Labour’s surprisingly strong performance at the general election, was a carnival. In 2018 the party strode left in its policy line-up. This time, the optimism had ebbed, even if the policies kept coming. “Are we going to get bollocked in the next election?” wondered one prominent supporter of Mr Corbyn.\n",
      "\n",
      "It took the judgment of the Supreme Court on September 24th and the humiliation of Boris Johnson to lift spirits. The same conference hall that was a sea of discontent when the Brexit policy was announced turned into an adoring mass when Mr Corbyn marched out and called for the prime minister to quit. “Boris Johnson has been found to have misled the country,” he declared. “This unelected prime minister should now resign.” Delegates erupted in cheers, their fights forgotten. For now. ■\n",
      "B first prime minister (Robert Walpole) and the current one (Boris Johnson) were educated at Eton College. So were 18 others in between. Annual fees are £42,501 ($52,508), which cushion an endowment of £436m. One in five pupils is the son of an Old Etonian. Around one in four will go to Oxford or Cambridge. Founded in 1440, the school has three theatres and three museums, as well as a rowing centre. When a campaign within the Labour Party to shut down private schools came to choose a slogan, there was an obvious choice: “Abolish Eton”.\n",
      "\n",
      "On September 22nd Labour Party conference attendees united around the rallying cry, passing a motion proposed by the campaign. It commits the party to three policies. First, it will withdraw charitable status and other tax privileges from private schools. Second, it will ensure that universities admit the same proportion of private-school pupils as exists in the wider population. Third, private-school assets will be “redistributed democratically and fairly across the country’s educational institutions”. Sol Gamsu, a sociologist at Durham University and an activist behind the campaign, hopes that a Labour government would enact the policies in sequence over two to three years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Private schools may be unusually vulnerable now. At a time of political crisis, “the fact that those responsible were educated at Eton is a great help for us,” says Mr Gamsu. Long beyond the reach of most, in recent years private schools have become still more of a luxury. According to Lloyds Private Banking, the average annual fee for day pupils last year was £14,289, up from £9,579 a decade earlier, an increase 19% above inflation. Less than 7% of children in England attend a private school, although a slightly higher proportion do at some point in their education. Research suggests the fees buy only a small boost to exam results: an upper estimate, which controls for things like family income, is 0.6 of a grade at , the exams sat at 16. But there is some evidence that they have a bigger impact on outcomes in the job market. Old-boy networks help (see article).\n",
      "\n",
      "The campaign was supported by senior figures in the party, including John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, Angela Rayner, the shadow education secretary, and Ed Miliband, a former leader. The Labour manifesto in 2017 had already committed to charging on fees, which would raise them by up to a fifth. That idea has fairly wide backing. Michael Gove, a Conservative cabinet minister, has complained that the current system “allows the wealthiest in this country…to buy a prestige service that secures their children a permanent positional edge in society at an effective 20% discount.” The motion also commits Labour to making schools pay business rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "To make these tax changes, Labour would have to strip private schools of their charitable status, which more than half currently enjoy. Doing so would require primary legislation, and could get messy, since the government would want to find a way to exempt those that provide specialist education, such as to disabled children. Barnaby Lenon, chairman of the Independent Schools Council, notes that even if the tax plans went ahead they would amount to a survivable inconvenience to the bigger, better-known schools, including Eton. Still, the number of private-school pupils would fall, and some schools, mostly preparatory ones (which take pupils until age 13), would probably go under.\n",
      "\n",
      "This would nevertheless be a long way short of the schools’ abolition. Ms Rayner said she would set up a review into how to integrate private schools into the state system, but stopped short of explicitly backing the other two proposals—university quotas and redistribution of schools’ assets—required by the conference motion. Universities would be furious about the imposition of limits on the number of private-school pupils they could recruit, and might find ways to get around it, including rejecting state funding. The wording of the motion is sufficiently vague that some Labour policy types think Ms Rayner could get away with pushing universities to make more use of “contextual admissions” (ie, requiring lower entry grades of children from state schools).\n",

      "Then there is the nuclear option. Nationalising private schools would be expensive, both in purchasing the schools’ assets and in educating 600,000 or so extra pupils. The Headmasters’ and Headmistresses’ Conference, a group of elite private schools, has vowed to fight in court any attempt to do so, with the sector arguing that nationalisation would contravene the European Convention on Human Rights, which guarantees a parent’s right to choose their child’s education.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is it clear this is a fight the party’s leadership wants to have. Despite his support for the campaign, in a private meeting Mr McDonnell opposed plans to nationalise private schools, and a number of unions are worried by the proposal. A poll by YouGov found that the public opposed abolition by two to one. So a less radical approach may emerge when Labour’s manifesto for the next election is drawn up. But, as the schools are aware, Labour would not need to nationalise them to make their life a lot more difficult. ■\n"

      "I 23 years ago, Gareth Lloyd-Jones was feeling the heat. After nearly 100 meetings around the City, he was no closer to floating his company on the stock exchange. Then, from among the steely faces, a young man stood up and announced that he would invest. “When you were at Rugby you were a great runner, and anyone who has that level of fitness I’m going to gamble on,” he declared. Mr Lloyd-Jones was taken aback. “I didn’t even know who he was,” he admits. “But I thought, ‘Well, this is interesting.’”\n",

      "Today, as president of the Rugbeian Society, he is overseeing a technological upgrade aimed at making such connections less coincidental. In July the club launched an app that allows alumni to seek everything from interns to fellow wine-enthusiasts. It has already been downloaded by more than 800 old boys and girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rugbeians aren’t the only ones going online. Of the 30 public schools in the Eton and Rugby groups, two clusters of swanky institutions that co-operate on curriculum-planning, sporting fixtures and so on, half have LinkedIn pages advertising internships. Nearly as many use a platform run by Graduway, which makes alumni-relations software that costs up to £10,000 ($12,360). Almost half run their own digital alumni networks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such clubs are part of a counter-offensive by private schools in a job market that has become saturated with graduates. Some 777,000 people left higher education last year, two-thirds more than two decades ago. Guy Beresford, a headhunter and self-described “careers bod” for the Old Oundelian Society, says that when he graduated in 1981 the club was mainly “black-tie dinners and going to golf”. Now, companies’ desire for diversity means it is “becoming tougher for private-school leavers to walk into top jobs and top universities, and we thought that any help we could give them would be valuable.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The Rugbeian Society runs 19 summer internships in 14 companies that are managed by alumni and organised on its various platforms by a full-time staff. School ties outweigh connections made later, believes Richard Brumpton, who got his job as a financial analyst through Rugby’s online platforms. “University is a much bigger operation where you have intimate relationships with less people, so you just fit into school networks a bit more.” As public schools have admitted more foreign pupils (and in some cases set up branches abroad), online networks have helped to connect far-flung old boys and girls.\n",
      "\n",
      "“I’m torn between ‘is it good?’ or ‘is it nepotism?’,” says Nick Mills, who used Old Rugbeian get-togethers to attract funding when he was setting up TicketText, a ticketing company, in 2012. “But I’m not going to go and bury my head in the sand, because it’s stupid not to use it.” Mr Mills is repaying the favour by mentoring young Rugbeians and letting the club use his London venue. Others are more cynical. Schools have invested in alumni societies “because they are interested in having enough people donating each month to fundraise for leaky roofs and new sports halls,” reckons one Old Harrovian.\n",
      "\n",
      "State schools are getting more interested in alumni networks, too. Future First, a charity, has helped more than a thousand comprehensives in poor areas to build networks, encouraging alumni to return to the schools to provide careers information. Future First’s Amy Cuffley says the aim is to “capitalise on the wealth of role models and volunteers these schools have—in the same way private schools already do.” ■\n",
      "T thunderclap of a ruling against the government on September 24th was a godsend for Jeremy Corbyn. It not only gave him an excuse to bring his Labour Party conference to a premature end by giving his speech a day early. It also allowed the party to dispense with a speech by Tom Watson, the deputy leader, that might have resulted in mass walkouts. There is nevertheless no doubt that this year’s conference, held in a rainy Brighton, was a miserable affair. An event that is designed to showcase the leader’s preparedness for power was overshadowed by the question of whether he should be preparing for retirement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The first sign of trouble was a failed attempt to remove Mr Watson from his job by Jon Lansman, the head of Mr Corbyn’s praetorian guard, Momentum. It is no secret that the left covets Mr Watson’s head. But Mr Lansman’s timing was odd given that his plot was guaranteed to ignite an internal war and send the media into a blood-frenzy. The only explanation is panic about the succession. Under current rules the deputy leader takes over temporarily if the leader resigns and therefore plays a role in choosing the next one.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second sign of trouble was a leaked memo by Andrew Fisher, a member of Mr Corbyn’s inner circle and an author of Labour’s 2017 manifesto. Mr Fisher lambasted Mr Corbyn’s office for its “blizzard of lies” and “lack of competence, professionalism and human decency”. The last two words were particularly cutting. He also warned that the party would not be able to win the next election with the current leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "The succession crisis is being driven by two numbers: 70 and 25. At 70, Mr Corbyn is on the old side for somebody who aspires to the most demanding job in British politics. And at 25, Labour’s average poll rating is much too low for a party that aspires to power. Labour should be well ahead of a government that blunders from crisis to crisis. Instead it is behind in every poll, sometimes by some distance. In this year’s European election Labour finished third, behind the Liberal Democrats. In two subsequent by-elections it has suffered double-digit declines in its vote share. Labour s from the Midlands and the north report that voters constantly tell them they will not back Labour so long as it is led by Mr Corbyn.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour Remainers (who make up the bulk of party members) are furious with Mr Corbyn’s fence-sitting over Brexit. Matthew Pennycook, a shadow Brexit minister, stepped down on September 25th to campaign for Remain. People across the party are disheartened by Mr Corbyn’s faltering performance. Though he bought himself a period of grace with his almost successful election campaign in 2017, that has now ended. He has made a succession of unforced errors that hurt deeply, not least asking for the Russians to be called in to help investigate the poisonings in Salisbury, and dragging his feet over investigating anti-Semitism in the party. It is a measure of Mr Corbyn’s leadership ability that he has managed to take a moderate position on the one subject, Brexit, where extreme positions are popular, and extreme positions on everything else.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Corbyn insists that he will not only lead his party into the next general election but also serve a full term as prime minister. He is probably right about the first, given that the next election could be a matter of weeks away. But he is almost certainly wrong about the second. A year in Downing Street is equivalent to several years of ordinary life. The more interesting question is not whether Mr Corbyn can survive for the next few months, but whether the “Corbyn project”, as Labour delegates call it, can survive his departure, be it the result of an election defeat or the toll of high office.\n",
      "\n",
      "For all his many faults Mr Corbyn is a consummate machine politician. His supporters control all the party’s great organs of power, from the National Executive Committee to the biggest trade union to the local parties. Mr Corbyn demonstrated his grip at the conference by engineering the defeat of a motion to throw the party’s weight behind Remain. Two big unions, Unite and the , voted as a bloc against the motion, the left-wing pressure group Momentum whipped its delegates to oppose it and, in a Soviet moment, Wendy Nichols, the chairwoman of the session, reversed her decision that the vote had passed after an intervention from Jennie Formby, the party’s general secretary. What’s more, the Corbyn project is driven by two men rather than one. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, remains as bright and omnipresent as ever despite his 68 years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Against that, the party’s middle ranks are much less supportive of the project. The Corbynites’ preferred successor, Rebecca Long-Bailey, the party’s energy spokeswoman, is a thin reed. A poor performer in Parliament and on television, she lacks both Mr Corbyn’s intermittent charm and Mr McDonnell’s iron grip on detail. By contrast, the party’s moderate wing has a plethora of more impressive figures. Emily Thornberry is a good parliamentary debater (and outshines Mr Corbyn when she stands in for him at prime minister’s questions); Sir Keir Starmer has transformed himself from a lawyer who happens to be in the politics business to an accomplished politician who happens to know a lot about the law; Hilary Benn and Yvette Cooper have a rare ability to articulate a moderate position in an age of polarisation. The most impressive members of the party’s next generation—Jess Philips, Angela Rayner and Lisa Nandy—have kept their distance from Corbynism.\n",
      "\n",
      "Labour’s ascendant left wing likes to think in terms of vast, impersonal, historical forces: the crisis of neo-liberalism, the death-agonies of imperialism and the rest of it. But the fate of Mr Corbyn’s great project to build socialism in Britain depends on the political machinations of a handful of individuals. The fact that the balance of power is so delicate means that the struggle can only become more bitter in the months to come. Mr Corbyn’s rise divided the party like nothing since the second world war. His eventual departure will divide it even further. ■\n"

      "I for the Supreme Court to give a unanimous judgment on a contentious appeal. But that is what happened on September 24th when it ruled that Boris Johnson’s prorogation of Parliament for five weeks until October 14th had been unlawful. The 11 justices upheld and even strengthened a Scottish lower-court judgment against the suspension, while overturning an English high-court finding that the issue was political and accordingly not suitable for judicial determination. In doing this, the court delivered a powerful blow to the prime minister’s authority.\n",
      "\n",
      "The blow was the more effective for the manner of its delivery. In a calm but mellifluous voice, the court’s president, Lady Hale, sporting a glittering spider brooch, read out a damning judgment against Mr Johnson. If there were no limit to the government’s ability to prorogue, that would be incompatible with parliamentary sovereignty. She cited a 1611 court ruling that “the King hath no prerogative, but that which the law of the land allows him.” She dismissed the government’s argument that a long suspension was needed to prepare a Queen’s Speech and new legislative agenda. She noted that it would limit parliamentary scrutiny. This mattered, she said, because of the exceptional circumstance that Brexit is due to happen on October 31st.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although the Supreme Court did not say so explicitly, its ruling implied that Mr Johnson had misled the queen when advising her in August to prorogue Parliament. Not surprisingly, the opposition Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, interrupted his party conference in Brighton to call on the prime minister to resign. -shirts with spider motifs quickly popped up on eBay, where they sold in their thousands. Coming after six successive defeats in the House of Commons, the passage of an act designed to prevent a no-deal Brexit, the resignation of two ministers and the removal of the Tory whip from 21 rebellious s, even the ebullient Mr Johnson might have been expected to feel some embarrassment or, just possibly, shame.\n",
      "\n",
      "Instead he doubled down. He said he profoundly disagreed with the court’s judgment. He offered no apology for his actions, even though they had been found unlawful. Although neither the government’s defence nor the court’s judgment suggested that prorogation was directly connected to Brexit, he declared ominously that a lot of people were seeking to frustrate it. And he continued to insist that Britain must leave the on October 31st, deal or no deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "As has happened before, some of his noisier supporters attacked the judges as part of an anti-Brexit establishment bent on thwarting the will of the people. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the Commons, reportedly spoke of a constitutional coup. A few Brexiteers suggested that justices should be subject to political vetting before appointment. Yet Geoffrey Cox, the attorney-general, declared that, although disagreeing with the judges was acceptable, impugning their motives was not. Indeed, the court ruling points to a constitution that is working, not to one that is broken.\n",
      "\n",
      "What next? The court declared that, because the prorogation was unlawful, it had not happened at all. John Bercow, the Speaker, duly recalled s to Westminster on September 25th. They asked about the attorney-general’s advice on prorogation, Mr Johnson’s relationship with an American entrepreneur (see article) and no-deal preparations. They subjected the prime minister to two hours of questioning, in which the Tory benches roared their approval for his bombast. But he shocked many by claiming that the way to honour the memory of Jo Cox, a pro-Remain Labour murdered in 2016 by a far-right fanatic, was to get Brexit done. Nicky Morgan, a cabinet minister, was among those who criticised his language.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson repeated his demand for an early election. But under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, two-thirds of s must vote for dissolution, so it needs Labour as well as Tory backing. Although Mr Corbyn said he too favoured an early election, he insisted that it was vital first to stop a no-deal Brexit happening on October 31st. That means ensuring that the so-called Benn act, which requires the government to seek an extension of that deadline if it has not agreed a Brexit deal by October 19th, works as planned before any dissolution.\n",
      "\n",
      "A final question is what effect all this may have on Mr Johnson’s negotiations for a new Brexit deal. He claimed again that these were making progress. Yet the still wants a legally binding, written alternative to the backstop (a mechanism to avert a hard border in Ireland), which Mr Johnson wants to excise from the withdrawal agreement. Brussels has dismissed four ideas recently put on the table by the British team. A 30-day deadline for a new plan hinted at by Angela Merkel, the German chancellor, in late August has been and gone. Suggestions by Mr Johnson’s team that he also wants to ditch earlier promises to avoid any border checks in Ireland by sticking closely to regulations are making it even harder to reach agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson’s lost authority after the Supreme Court judgment will serve further to emphasise his weak position in Brussels. His loss of parliamentary control was anyway making his negotiating partners nervous about offering concessions. The side fears that, just as Westminster rejected the deal struck last year with Theresa May three times, so it could do the same to any deal done with Mr Johnson. The Supreme Court ruling will make it harder for the prime minister to find some clever way round the Benn act. So the is assuming that, if no deal is reached at the European Council on October 17th-18th, Mr Johnson will be forced to ask for more time.\n",
      "\n",
      "Weary though it is of the whole issue, Brussels is likely to say yes to a further extension of at least a few months. The expectation is that Mr Johnson will then secure an election. He wants to run by standing up for the people, who voted to leave the , against an establishment blocking the way. His humiliation by the court this week may do that populist strategy no harm.■\n",
      "I week, for any other prime minister, it would have been a career-threatening scandal. On September 22nd the Sunday Times published a cracker of a story alleging that during his time as mayor of London in 2008-16, Boris Johnson failed to declare his friendship with Jennifer Arcuri, a young American businesswoman then resident in London. According to the paper, Ms Arcuri joined three foreign trade missions with Mr Johnson in one year, despite being ineligible for any of them. She also received at least £11,500 ($18,000) in funding from London and Partners, a promotional body overseen by the mayor. Another of Ms Arcuri’s companies received £100,000 from the culture department. Mr Johnson spoke at several tech gatherings organised by Ms Arcuri and is said to have frequently visited her Shoreditch flat during lunch breaks, for what she reportedly says were technology lessons.\n",
      "\n",
      "But this is not any other week. Asked about his links to Ms Arcuri on his way to the general assembly, Mr Johnson six times refused to answer. When he eventually broke his silence, it was only to say: “Everything was done with complete propriety and in the normal way.” Reporters scented blood. Yet after the Supreme Court delivered its dramatic verdict on September 24th, the Arcuri affair was relegated to the middle pages.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is this any other prime minister. In his two months in office Mr Johnson has made a habit of violating the norms on which the British system of government is based. Dan Hough of the Centre for the Study of Corruption at the University of Sussex likens the British system to cricket, where lots of rules are unwritten but respected nonetheless. Contrast that with football, where players feign fouls to gain control of the ball. Mr Johnson’s government is applying the logic of football to a system run more like cricket. Once such codes are breached, it can be nearly impossible to reinstate them, says Mr Hough. And the more often it happens, the less scandalous it appears.\n",
      "\n",
      "The penalties can be light, too. The London Assembly has given Mr Johnson 14 days to provide a timeline of his contact with Ms Arcuri and to explain his relationship with her. But although it can investigate breaches of its code of conduct, it “has no legal powers to apply formal sanctions”. Parliament has an “independent adviser on ministerial interests” who is empowered to conduct investigations—but only if instructed to do so by the prime minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson is not off the hook. s, now back in Westminster, are burrowing into the affair. Newspapers are enjoying the chance to print stories that combine details of the alleged conflict of interest with snippets about Ms Arcuri’s former career as a model and her reported enthusiasm for pole-dancing. Nazir Afzal, a former chief prosecutor, has said that, if proven, the allegations against Mr Johnson could amount to criminal misconduct in public office. The story may not be off the front pages for ever.\n"

      "T began life in July 1841, offering day-trips between Leicester and Loughborough to teetotallers. It counted Mark Twain, Rudyard Kipling and Winston Churchill among its customers, before evolving into a leading modern package-holiday firm. But its story ended ignominiously this week, with some holidaymakers locked in hotels by security guards demanding that they pay again for their rooms. Some 600,000 tourists, a quarter British, were left stranded when the world’s oldest holiday firm collapsed into liquidation on September 23rd after a decade of financial trouble. It leaves behind big questions over who should pay to rescue stranded holidaymakers in future.\n",
      "\n",
      "Until recently Thomas Cook seemed likely to escape bankruptcy. Fosun, a Chinese conglomerate keen to deploy the Cook brand in Asia, and the firm’s lenders had agreed to rescue the company with a cash injection of £900m ($1.1bn). But on September 20th its main banks threatened to withdraw their support if the group was not able to find an additional £200m, which they calculated it would need to survive the lean winter months. None of its backers was prepared to cough up. A last-minute appeal to Britain’s government for a bail-out fell on deaf ears. Grant Shapps, the transport secretary, later said the company was in such a bad state that bailing it out would involve “throwing good money after bad”.\n",
      "\n",
      "What went wrong? Thomas Cook has earned most of its money since the 1990s selling package holidays, which include some combination of flights, accommodation and food. Since then the industry has often been presented as in decline, in part because of Thomas Cook’s woes. Monarch Airlines, which specialised in package deals, collapsed two years ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet package holidays are not in decline; if anything, the industry is enjoying a resurgence. In the past decade their market share against trips booked as separate components has grown. The number of Britons going on “inclusive tours” rose from 14.3m to 18.2m in 2010-18. Half of Britons’ trips abroad are package holidays, reckons the Association of British Travel Agents. They are often cheaper, as firms like Thomas Cook can use their scale to negotiate lower prices on rooms and flights. The popularity of “Love Island”, a reality- show featuring buff bodies and plenty of snogging in a holiday villa in Mallorca, has also boosted their street cred among youngsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus it is mainly Thomas Cook’s business decisions that are to blame for its demise. The company took on a mountain of debt when it merged with MyTravel Group, a rival, in 2007. An ill-judged series of takeovers added to it. It could never shake off this debt; the hole in its balance-sheet was £3.1bn by its collapse. Its 550 branches in Britain also swelled its overheads.\n",
      "\n",
      "New online-only travel agents, such as On the Beach and We Love Holidays, now Britain’s fourth- and fifth-biggest package-holiday operators, easily undercut Thomas Cook on price. Cook’s big bets on Tunisia and Turkey just before they were hit by a series of terrorist attacks in 2015 did not pay off. Good weather at home last year and uncertainty around Brexit this year also depressed its bookings. The £1.5bn in losses it made in the six months to March fatally wounded its balance-sheet.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain is now repatriating over 150,000 of its nationals—its biggest evacuation since the second world war—at a cost of around £100m. , a government-backed scheme that insures package holidays against bankruptcy, will pay for the 60% of passengers travelling on such deals, while the government will bail out the rest. That is a sore point for package-holiday firms, who feel that they are paying £2.50 per passenger into for a service that non-package holidaymakers get for free. The government, meanwhile, worries that the scheme incentivises travel firms to take financial risks, knowing that they will not pick up the tab if they fail.\n",
      "\n",
      "In May a government review, set up after Monarch’s collapse, recommended adding a 50p levy to every air fare to help pay for future repatriations. That would shift the burden away from the state, but do little to help prevent another collapse of Thomas Cook’s size. ■\n",

      "BRITAIN’S SUPREME COURT has ruled unlawful Boris Johnson’s five-week suspension of Parliament. In a unanimous judgment read out by the court’s president, Lady Hale, the justices ruled that the prime minister’s action prevented Parliament from carrying out its constitutional functions without reasonable justification.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Speaker of the House of Commons, John Bercow, has summoned MPs to sit on September 25th. That will not allow enough time to hold the usual Question Time with the prime minister, but Mr Bercow said MPs could table urgent questions and motions. Mr Johnson is expected to cut short his trip to the United Nations in New York, and return in time for the sessions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Opposition leaders—among them Jeremy Corbyn, the Labour leader who has brought forward his speech to the party’s conference in Brighton—called for Mr Johnson to resign. He is not likely to do that, but his own Tory party conference next week may now not take place.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgment is devastating for the prime minister. Not only did he lose on every legal point, and do so unanimously, but also the justices in effect implied that he had misled the queen when seeking her agreement to the suspension with advice that “was unlawful, void and of no effect.” He had claimed this was necessary to prepare for a new legislative session to start on October 14th. The Supreme Court ruling says that it obstructed parliamentary scrutiny, declaring: “The effect upon the fundamentals of our democracy was extreme.”\n",
      "\n",
      "How will this affect Brexit? Mr Johnson says he “strongly disagrees” with the ruling, and still insists that Britain will leave the EU “come what may” on October 31st. Yet Parliament has legislated to insist that, if he has not secured a Brexit deal with the European Union by October 19th, he must seek an extension of that deadline. Although Mr Johnson insists he is making good progress towards an agreement, few in Brussels agree. The gap between the two sides over the so-called backstop to avert a hard border in Ireland is wide. The chances of a deal by mid-October still look small.\n",
      "\n",
      "The judgment also plays into a broader constitutional crisis in Britain. Mr Johnson and his team are trying to portray MPs, big business, much of the media and now the judiciary as implacable opponents of Brexit, bent on thwarting the wishes of the majority of voters who supported Leave in June 2016. The Supreme Court would certainly deny the charge: Lady Hale said its decision was about the government’s prerogative powers, not about Brexit at all. Yet Mr Johnson would like nothing better than to fight an election on a platform of the people versus the establishment.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far Mr Corbyn has resisted calls for an early election (his agreement is needed because it takes a two-thirds majority of MPs to vote for dissolution). But when Parliament resumes, he will face pressure to change his mind, especially if Mr Johnson concedes that a no-deal Brexit will not in fact happen on October 31st. Whether an election can either resolve Brexit or repair Britain’s battered constitution is quite another matter.\n",
      "A seven days, turbine parts are loaded onto a giant ship in Hull docks: blades measuring 75 metres (250 feet), 90-metre-high towers and 400-tonne nacelles, the masses of steel, fibreglass and gears that together transform wind into power. The ship brings its cargo 120km into the North Sea, where foundations wait in the waves. Workers erect four wind turbines, then the ship returns to shore for more parts. In the next few weeks installations for the Hornsea One project will be completed, with 174 turbines dotted across 407 square kilometres of water. It will be the largest offshore wind farm in the world. Hornsea Two, already planned, will be bigger still.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain is already the world’s largest offshore wind market. Last year turbines planted off its coasts had eight gigawatts ( ) of capacity, about a third more than the next-biggest market, Germany. That number is due to jump. In 2030 Britain will have 30 of offshore wind capacity, forecasts Bloomberg , an energy data firm, second only to China, which is set to zoom ahead (see chart). Britain’s Committee on Climate Change expects investment to continue, with offshore wind a crucial part of the government’s efforts to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050.\n",
      "\n",
      "To some, Britain proves how government can spur the rapid deployment of clean technology. To others, it shows the cost of meddling in power markets. Both assessments are correct.\n",
      "\n",
      "Governments around the world are seeking to slash emissions from electricity generation, a task made more urgent by the shift to electric cars. Offshore wind has natural appeal. The wind blows at night and in winter, complementing the power from solar panels. Place turbines in the sea and you also dodge the s who detest them on land. Even so, offshore wind’s global capacity is about one-twentieth that of onshore wind or solar. The main reason is that, until very recently, it was extremely expensive.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Britain has seen a boom. That is due in part to geography, with high winds and shallow seas, and in part to policy. Britain’s push for renewable power gained steam in 2008, when the Climate Change Act required greenhouse-gas emissions in 2050 to be at least 80% below their level in 1990. Politicians have favoured offshore wind, funding research and a giant facility in Northumberland to test blades. Most important, however, has been subsidy.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government decided to provide more financial support to early large-scale wind farms, such as the London Array off the Kent coast, completed in 2013, than to onshore wind or solar. Offshore wind was capital-intensive and immature, the logic went, so needed help. In 2013 ministers authorised competitive auctions for low-carbon power. Companies bid to supply electricity in 15-year contracts and the government pays the difference between the bid price and the market price. Since 2015, those auctions have excluded onshore wind and solar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Long contracts gave companies the certainty to invest. Siemens Gamesa, which is making the turbines for Hornsea One, decided in 2014 to build a blade factory in Hull. “We could see there was volume coming,” explains Clark MacFarlane, who runs the company’s British business. Siemens will build longer blades in Hull for Hornsea Two, so more power can be generated from fewer turbines, lowering installation costs. The new turbines’ diameter will be 167 metres, 40% wider than the London Eye.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rest of the industry has matured, too. Orsted, a Danish firm that is now the world’s biggest offshore-wind developer, cut its teeth in Britain. In 2014 it won contracts to build three big wind farms, including Hornsea One. “It allowed us to start industrialising the way we built,” says Henrik Poulsen, the firm’s boss. Orsted made bulk purchases of turbines and cables, and refined each stage of development, from site planning to maintenance.\n",
      "\n",
      "By some measures, results have been a big success. In the past decade offshore-wind capacity in Britain has grown 20-fold, meaning it now comprises a quarter of renewable generation. The lowest price secured in the first round of auctions, in 2015, was £114.39 ($142) per megawatt hour ( h). In 2017 the cheapest projects, including Orsted’s Hornsea Two, won with bids of just £57.50. The next contracts are expected to be announced on September 20th.* Other countries, including America and Taiwan, now have their own plans for offshore wind, benefiting from the expertise that companies honed in Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, big questions loom. In March the government announced an agreement with the offshore-wind industry that it hopes will amplify its economic impact. The government will hold auctions every two years. In return, it said, “we expect the sector to continue cutting costs, committing to lower their impact on bill-payers, while investing in and driving growth in the ’s manufacturing base.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Offshore wind has produced factory jobs, as at the plant in Hull. But it is not clear that creating British manufacturing jobs advances the aim to lower power prices, given Britain’s relatively high labour costs. Richard Howard of Aurora Energy Research, an analytics firm, points out that the country has expertise in building and servicing wind farms, as well as exploring technical problems through research. Britain “doesn’t tend to have a comparative advantage in making things—it tends to have a comparative advantage in making knowledge.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The debate over costs may escalate, too. In 2017 Dieter Helm of Oxford University wrote a scathing review of Britain’s energy market, pointing out that consumers were paying high prices even as the cost of renewables plunged. He named lengthy, generous offshore-wind contracts as a principal culprit. Orsted agreed to build Hornsea One for £140 per h, about three times today’s wholesale price. Last year environmental policies accounted for a fifth of consumers’ electricity bills, according to Ofgem, the energy regulator. Mr Helm argues that an economy-wide carbon price would help the country choose the cheapest power with the lowest emissions. Instead, he says, “we make those choices by protecting different technologies.”\n",
      "\n",
      "As Britain aims for net-zero, it must also grapple with the broader challenge of balancing the grid. This year the Committee on Climate Change suggested that offshore wind capacity may reach a staggering 75 in 2050. That would require about 180 of today’s biggest turbines to be installed in each of the next 30 years. Generating that much more power from intermittent sources will need investment in technology that does not yet exist, including batteries that can store power for weeks.\n",
      "\n",
      "The current state of the grid does not inspire confidence. Lightning strikes on August 9th contributed to halting operations at Hornsea One and a small gas plant, causing a power-cut. The blackout illuminated broader problems in Britain’s electricity system that will need to be resolved as it tries to decarbonise. The government was due to publish an energy white paper this year to deal with such questions. Amid broader political turmoil, the paper, like so much else, has been put on hold. ■\n",

      "T of Molly, a 19-year-old at the University of Portsmouth, the Waterhole Bar is no more. “I enjoyed pre-ing in there with friends,” she sighs. “We’d get together, have a few snakebites, get hyped.” Access was restricted to students, meaning it felt safe. Karaoke Fridays were fun. But students were recently told the bar would be replaced with a “vibrant, student-centred and social-gathering space”.\n",
      "\n",
      "In a pre-mobile-phone era, university bars were a place to bump into people you knew and enjoy cheap drinks. Brewers sold booze at below cost price to get students hooked on certain brands. No longer. Abertay, in Dundee, has also closed its bar. Chester and Coventry have transformed theirs into “events spaces”. Many have already become places which offer not just alcohol but also pizzas, coffee and laptop charging, notes Jim Dickinson of Wonkhe, a think-tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the 2000s pubs began competing harder for students’ custom, taking business away from university bars. And young people are drinking less. Three in ten 16- to 24-year-olds are teetotal, up from two in ten in 2005. Many of those who indulge will pre-drink at a friend’s flat, rather than a bar, before heading to a club. To stroll through Portsmouth’s campus in freshers week is to be bombarded with information about nights out: Dirty Disco (drinks: £1.50, or $1.90), Connection (“indie, retro and electro alternative”) and the Eskimo Project (“the club so big it requires 2 venues”).\n",
      "\n",
      "Ben Archer, a third-year student, stayed away from the Waterhole. “It was quite grim, it didn’t smell great,” he recalls. College bars were not the best places to induct foreign students—who make up 14% of undergraduates—into British drinking culture. And the culture has anyway been watered down, says Ian Dunn, Coventry University’s provost. “Students are more serious about study,” he explains. “The library is full.”\n",
      "T waiting room stretches the length and breadth of Britain. Somewhere in the queue is a 35-year-old Nigerian called Kemi. When she applied for asylum, in 2016, London seemed like heaven compared with the domestic abuse she suffered back home. She came to study but stayed after becoming pregnant, fearing that her baby, like her other two daughters, would suffer genital mutilation if she went back. Now, Britain seems closer to purgatory. She shares her flat with two other families. Antidepressants offer little respite. When her £38 ($47) weekly allowance runs out, she sometimes begs for money. Yet, like almost all those on the asylum waiting list, she is banned from working. “I have my hands, I have my skills,” she says. “I don’t need the government’s money. I want to be able to make my own.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The queue moves slowly. About half of asylum applicants wait more than six months for a decision, up from a fifth in 2015. Applications fell during this period, but staff were diverted to clear a backlog of candidates waiting more than ten years for a decision and to run the post-Brexit settlement scheme for Europeans, says Jill Rutter of British Future, a think-tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "The logjam has rekindled opposition to the work ban. Most rich countries allow asylum-seekers to work within a few months of submitting an application. They can take a job straight away in Canada and Sweden and after six months in America. In Britain, they could work after six months until 2002, when the then Labour government imposed the ban after a surge in asylum applications. Officials reckoned making money while on the waiting list encouraged applications, even by those with little chance of success. Since 2010, those on the list for more than a year can work, but only if they take a job on the government’s list of shortage occupations. “It was not a very useful shift,” says Ms Rutter. “They’ve very specific jobs: radiographer, ballet dancer.”\n",
      "\n",
      "There is little evidence that the work ban deters migrants. Surveys of asylum-seekers find that only a sixth knew before they came to Britain that they would not be able to work. Kemi was among those who assumed she would find a job. Factors such as ability to speak the language and the presence of relatives and friends have a greater bearing on a migrant’s decision to come to a particular country than short-term concerns like the application process.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lifting the ban would clearly help asylum-seekers themselves. Forced inactivity allows skills to atrophy and can contribute to mental illness, says Cornelius Katona of the Helen Bamber Foundation, a charity. The job ban also cheats the taxpayer, as in practice many asylum-seekers find work in the grey economy. Two-thirds of legitimate company bosses think they should be allowed to work after six months, according to a poll published on September 16th by Refugee Action, another charity. And changing the rules would not necessarily prove a vote-loser. British Future found that the vast majority of voters do not know about the ban. More than two-thirds would support a right to work after six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ban is at odds with the rhetoric of recent governments that benefit claimants must contribute to society. “It goes hugely against the man on the street’s common sense,” says Stephen Hale of Refugee Action. Lifting the ban may be too good an opportunity to pass up. The Home Office does not often have the chance to please do-gooders, populists and bosses at once. ■\n",
      "F days, the ExCeL convention centre in east London was transformed into a Disneyland for arms dealers. On September 10th-13th Defence & Security Equipment International ( ), one of the world’s largest weapons bazaars, filled its cavernous halls with enough tanks, missiles and drones to invade a small country. Towering above all of these was a full-sized model of a sleek warplane with sprawling wings and a nose like a bulbous arrowhead.\n",
      "\n",
      "The aircraft in question, Tempest, is to be the jewel in the crown of Britain’s £23bn ($29bn) defence industry. In two decades Britain’s Eurofighter Typhoons will be retiring and the fifth-generation -35 Lightning will be creaking at the joints. If Britain wants to keep flying world-class warplanes, and to retain the expertise to build and export them, it must start work now. To that end, in July 2018 the government announced nearly £2bn of funding over ten years as part of its Combat Air Strategy.\n",
      "\n",
      "Over 1,000 people are working on Team Tempest, as the consortium of Systems, Rolls-Royce, Leonardo and is known, with that number set to rise to 2,500 by 2021. The plan is to get the Tempest in the air by 2035—and to “take Global Britain into the stratosphere”, as Ben Wallace, the defence secretary, put it at .\n",
      "\n",
      "Since modern warplanes are eye-wateringly expensive to build and buy, few countries embark on the effort alone. Britain chalked up its first success in July, when Sweden—a proficient manufacturer of fighter jets, through Saab—agreed to co-operate on future aircraft, beginning with a one-year study due in autumn 2020. Then on September 10th Italy announced that it would also partner with Team Tempest. Britain hopes that those decisions will sway others who are mulling over the future of their fleets, bringing technological know-how and economies of scale. Japan, Australia and Turkey are all mooted as potential partners.\n",
      "\n",
      "The catch is that other warplanes are available. Several European countries are co-operating to build their own sixth-generation “air system” (a term that reflects the fact that the warplane itself will be only one part of a larger network, which might include drone swarms). France, which shunned participation in the European Typhoon project and the American-led -35, favours its own national champion, Dassault. Moreover, France and Germany both want the European Union to develop a more integrated and mature defence industry, capable of holding its own against American behemoths.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Paris Air Show in June, the French, German and Spanish defence ministers announced a partnership between Dassault and Airbus, funded with €4bn ($4.4bn) to 2025, building on an earlier Tempest-like initiative known as Future Combat Air System. It was a “big day for the European defence union”, noted Ursula von der Leyen, then German defence minister and now president-elect of the European Commission.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet for all this flurry of activity, there is scepticism that the result will be two flying planes. “Competition among Europeans when it weakens us against the Americans [and] the Chinese is ridiculous,” complained Emmanuel Macron, France’s president, in June. The economic logic might suggest that the British-led project and continental one ought to merge. But the political logic says otherwise. France is set on a plane that can take off from aircraft-carriers and carry nuclear bombs, whereas Britain has the -35 for that. The rivalry between and Dassault will also be hard to surmount; neither would readily give up its lead status. And Britain’s close military ties with America make it sceptical of the idea of a common European defence-industrial front.\n",
      "\n",
      "As ever, Brexit adds a wrinkle. If and when Britain leaves the , it will be pushed to the fringes of the bloc’s defence projects, and cut out of some entirely. Earlier this month Britain even asked the to downgrade the defence pledges made in the non-binding political declaration of the withdrawal agreement, seeking a more complete break. Many Europeans would consider it odd for the bloc to bolster its indigenous defence capabilities, only to put its future air-power in the hands of a diplomatically freewheeling outsider. ■\n"

      "S first wave of Bangladeshi migrants arrived in Britain in the 1970s, foreign-born preachers have held sway in the community. For a while the most visible consequence to outsiders was when Bangladeshi restaurants stopped selling alcohol, after conservative clerics such as Delwar Hossain Sayeedi came to preach temperance to the diaspora in the 1990s (some curry houses found a theological loophole in the form of “bring your own booze”). Recent years have seen more serious worries about the influence of foreign extremists. In February Shamima Begum, an east-London schoolgirl, was stripped of her British citizenship after running away to join Islamic State ( ) in Syria.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet in Dhaka, amid a rising tempo of terrorist attacks, officials are asking who is radicalising whom. Bangladesh’s government often blames outsiders for its problem with radical Islam. But here it has a point. British citizens have been implicated in the planning, funding and promotion of terrorism in Bangladesh, to the alarm of the country’s security services. “We do not know what is driving radicalisation in Britain,” says a senior officer in Bangladesh’s Counter-Terrorism Intelligence Bureau, “but it is contaminating our society.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Britain’s exporting of radical Islam goes back a long way. Syed Golam Maula, the founder of the Bangladeshi chapter of Hizb-ut-Tahrir, an Islamist movement that is banned in Bangladesh but not in Britain, was introduced to the organisation while studying in London in the early 1990s. In 2015 Sheikh Hasina Wajed, the prime minister, complained to her opposite number, David Cameron, that British citizens were promoting radicalism in her country. Her comments came after religious extremists targeted gay activists, atheist bloggers and religious minorities. Touhidur Rahman, a Briton of Bangladeshi origin, was accused of (but never charged with) planning the murder of two secular bloggers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Earlier this year Bangladeshi police arrested Rizwan Haroon, who had previously lived in Britain, on suspicion of using a school in Dhaka to recruit youngsters to . He is awaiting trial. According to America’s , Siful Haque Sujan, a Bangladeshi-born British citizen believed to have been killed in Syria in 2015, was a leading figure in who used eBay to send money to operatives in Britain and America. An American military report found that he had set up shell companies in Bangladesh, Britain and Spain to move funds and drones on behalf of the terrorist organisation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Britons are by no means the only difficult part of the Bangladeshi diaspora. One of the perpetrators of a deadly attack in 2016 on the Holey Artisan Bakery in Dhaka was Canadian. But intelligence agencies are particularly interested in Britain, whose 600,000 people of Bangladeshi origin make up the largest Western chunk of the diaspora. Some half a billion dollars in remittances are sent to Bangladesh from Britain each year, according to the World Bank, more than from any other Western country (though much less than from the Gulf states, where many Bangladeshis toil).\n",
      "\n",
      "Cash from Green Crescent, a now-defunct British charity, was connected by Bangladeshi security services to the Holey Bakery attack. In 2009 Bangladeshi forces raided a madrassa funded by Green Crescent and found weapons and extremist literature. They claim the charity’s British founder, Faisal Mostafa, has links to Jamaat-ul-Mujahideen, a terrorist outfit, which he denies. He has twice been acquitted of terrorism offences in Britain. “Green Crescent is likely just the tip of the iceberg,” says Rakib Ehsan of the Henry Jackson Society, a think-tank. “We have no way of tracing even a fraction of the charitable funds that go from the to Bangladesh.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The home and away communities are “surprisingly linked…much more so than other diaspora communities,” says Kamaldeep Bhui, an extremism expert at Queen Mary University of London. Most British-Bangladeshis come from a single region, Sylhet, and 70% live in London, so ties are strong. This has fostered the continuity of cultural norms and for a long time “shielded” Bangladeshis from extremist ideas, argues Tahir Abbas of Leiden University. “British Bangladeshis weren’t so much on the map in terms of these issues—until Islamic State,” he says. Perhaps 100 of the 800 or so Britons who have joined are of Bangladeshi origin. Bangladeshis are disproportionately represented on Britain’s terrorist watch-list, according to officials in both countries. Last year one, Naa’imur Rahman, was convicted of plotting to kill the then prime minister, Theresa May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ali Riaz of Illinois State University argues that the government’s response to 9/11 lumped together all Muslims, making many identify more with their religion than their nationality or ethnic origin. This has made them vulnerable to the universalist messages of groups like . Disillusioned youngsters “try to reclaim elements of their past, of their country of origin—religion can be the easiest thing to grab hold of,” says Mr Bhui. Some become more orthodox than their parents. Orthodoxy is not the same as extremism, he notes, “but extremist groups can hide easily in orthodoxy.” It does not help that Bangladeshis are the poorest ethnic group in Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "In Dhaka, keeping tabs on happenings in Tower Hamlets is hard. Some suspects are wanted in Bangladesh but operate freely in Britain, a source of frustration for Bangladeshi intelligence services. Despite what counter-terrorism chiefs describe as a high level of co-operation, the flow of information is hindered by the two intelligence services’ very different cultures. Bangladeshi spooks freely haul people in for questioning, tap phones and tail suspicious folk (including Economist correspondents). Torture is common; extra-judicial killing is neither unusual nor even much covered up. This reduces Britain’s willingness to share information. “We respect the cultures of the countries we work with and we limit our expectations,” says the Bangladeshi counter-terrorism officer.\n",
      "\n",
      "The ideas, money and recruitment essential to extremism no longer move neatly from one country another, notes Mr Riaz, but in a “confusing whirlwind”. The challenge facing British and Bangladeshi intelligence is far more complex than when preachers such as Mr Sayeedi, who is now behind bars in Bangladesh, were banishing booze from east London’s curry houses. ■\n",
      "T do not like Brexit. To clear up any lingering doubts about this, at their conference in Bournemouth a batch of their freshly elected s strode on stage wearing “ ” -shirts. Elsewhere, activists wearing blue berets spangled with stars wandered around hawking “Bollocks to Brexit” stickers. For those who had still not got the message, Jo Swinson, the party’s leader, unveiled a new policy: if the Lib Dems win the next election, they will revoke Britain’s Article 50 request to leave the “on day one”.\n",
      "\n",
      "While Labour has wobbled on Brexit, the Lib Dems have dug in as the party of Remain. Their previous policy was to support a second referendum, which they have called for consistently since the first one, in 2016. The party says it will still back a second referendum if, as is almost inevitable, it fails to win a majority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all are happy with the revoke policy. Grandees grumbled. Sir Norman Lamb, one of the party’s more Eurosceptic s, complained that simply revoking would annoy voters in the rural south-west, where the Lib Dems hope to gain seats, and his own constituency of North Norfolk. Brexit tore up old electoral alliances. The Lib Dems have historically relied on a mix of university towns and well-to-do suburbs (which tended to back Remain) and rural seats (where Leave was popular). Wavering Tory Remain-voters may think it a bit rum to ditch Brexit without another vote on the matter. And many of the Lib Dems’ most winnable seats are Tory ones (see chart).\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the move will please the party’s growing base of Remainers. Remain-voters prefer cancellation of Brexit to a second referendum by two to one, according to a poll by Opinium. A petition calling for the revocation of Article 50 was signed by 6.1m people—nearly three times more than voted Lib Dem in the general election of 2017. Defenders of the revoke policy point out that it has attracted attention to the party, and contrast its clarity with Labour’s evolving muddle. Labour would hold a second referendum but its leader, Jeremy Corbyn, said on September 17th that he would be neutral during the campaign.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unless polls are wildly wrong, the Lib Dems’ promise to revoke Article 50 could prove as relevant as a Sunday-league footballer’s plan for an elaborate celebration should he score in an Cup final. If the party wins its predicted 20% or so, Ms Swinson will not go to Downing Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Still, optimism abounded in Bournemouth. Normally the annual conference is a form of therapy for Lib Dems, jokes Tim Farron, who led the party in 2015-17 while it was on life support, with 8% of the vote and only eight s. Now its s are bombastic. Chuka Umunna, who defected from Labour (via Change ) this summer, suggested that 200 seats would be in contention if the party got a 5% swing. When a party wins more than about a quarter of the vote, a deluge of seats follows, under the logic of the first-past-the-post system.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet local politics can trump national swings. Remainers are clustered in cities and Scotland, whereas Leavers are scattered more evenly, making it easier for pro-Brexit parties to pick up seats. A modest headwind could blow the Lib Dems off course. Only one of their 18 seats—Orkney and Shetland—is truly safe. The Lib Dems are inches from both disaster and glory.\n",
      "\n",
      "Either way, they may play kingmaker. Ms Swinson has ruled out any formal coalition or pact with either Labour or the Conservatives. Instead the party will vote on a case-by-case basis, says Sir Ed Davey, its finance spokesman. The Lib Dems were burnt when a tie-up with the Tories in 2010-15 resulted in them losing 90% of their s in the next election. Breaking popular manifesto promises, such as ending tuition fees, did the most damage. When it comes to Brexit, the Lib Dems will try not to make the same mistake twice. ■\n"

After a pause for thought, she replied: “I think I did pretty well the first time.” I don’t feel quite the same way. I was wrong to withdraw Conservative s from the European Parliament’s centre-right alliance. I was wrong to surround myself with so many chums from school and university. On reflection the “Big Society” contained too much hot air. But I do pride myself on one thing: I left behind a country that was far more at ease with itself than the one I inherited.\n",

      "The reason for this was the defining act of my career, the Brexit referendum of 2016. After the result was announced, the pundit class assured me with one voice that I didn’t deserve any credit for doing the blindingly obvious. “Mr Cameron was confronted with an open goal,” the Times editorialised. “All he did was kick the ball.” These were often the same people who, before the vote, had informed me that I risked unleashing monsters. I can only say that the referendum didn’t feel like an open goal at the time. The campaign tore the country apart and strained some of my closest friendships. And the result was worryingly close. I sometimes torment myself, in my more masochistic moments, by imagining what might have happened had it gone the other way!\n",

I’m told that he has built quite a place in southern Florida—a mock-Tudor mansion complete with red telephone boxes and a working pub serving real ale, pie and mash. With his guiding hand removed, the Independence Party was captured by people who were so nauseating and ill-disciplined that membership collapsed. The Daily Mail was the only big-selling newspaper to continue to champion the lost cause and, after a particularly foam-flecked leader about “the traitor in Downing Street”, Viscount Rothermere stepped in to replace Paul Dacre with Geordie Greig, a sensible man as well as a good friend.\n",

      "What went unreported at the time was that the death of Euroscepticism also took a lot of work on my part. A good chunk of the Tory party had campaigned for the losing side. Millions of good people had voted to leave, not because they were fed up with Europe but because they were fed up with Britain. I tackled the Tory problem by forgiving the most talented Leavers, such as Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, while simultaneously marginalising the irreconcilables. New s only have to look at the desiccated hulks of Iain Duncan Smith and Jacob Rees-Mogg lounging in the parliamentary tea-room to know their fate if they step out of line. I dealt with the problem of the left-behind by announcing the end of austerity at the 2017 party conference and encouraging Boris, as business secretary, to make revitalising the north and the Midlands his priority—or, as he put it, a matter of “do or die”.\n",

First, you can’t be a part-time member of the club—you have to put in time sitting on the committees. Second, you can’t underestimate the inflexibility of transnational bureaucrats. I kept up the pressure, ably assisted by Sir Ivan Rogers, agitating for the completion of the single market in services and issuing blood-curdling warnings about what would happen if they didn’t rethink freedom of movement.

At one point the fanatic was even overheard muttering “Fuck business.” Tony Blair used to say he felt physically sick while preparing for prime minister’s questions against William Hague.

He introduced a programme of “rolling deselections” to weed out moderates. (One of the things that makes me proud to be a Conservative is that we would never stoop to deselecting s.)

      "There is no doubt that Mr Bercow is a Remainer. But the accusation of left-wing bias is debatable. He was originally elected as a Tory. The theme of his speakership has been support for s, not for Labour. Before the referendum he championed the rights of pro-Brexit Tory backbenchers. This week’s ruling by the Scottish courts against proroguing Parliament lends independent support to his view of the matter. The problem is not Mr Bercow but the way the referendum is testing all Britain’s institutions.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Conservative Party is nonetheless so fed up with Mr Bercow that it intended to break with convention by contesting his seat, Buckingham (a safe Tory constituency), at the next election. His decision to retire not only deprives the Tories of the pleasure of taking his scalp. It also ensures that the job of appointing his successor will fall to this parliament, with its resurgent anti-government alliance, rather than the next.\n",

      "A leadership election hobbled on, the London Evening Standard hoped that Boris Johnson would prove a “big-hearted, optimistic, liberal” leader. They expected that as prime minister he would reassure millions of socially liberal voters who backed Remain. Yet in his nearly two months in Downing Street, the liberal Mr Johnson has been absent. His authoritarian alter-ego has stolen the show by suspending Parliament, ditching plans to abandon short prison sentences and delivering a speech in front of a phalanx of uniformed coppers. When he droned on for so long that one of them fainted, he didn’t look terribly big-hearted either.\n",
      "\n",
      "This week the liberal returned—at least for a day. On September 11th he announced that foreign students will be allowed to stay in Britain for two years after their degrees while working or looking for a job, rather than the current four months. It is the most significant sign yet that Mr Johnson’s government will abandon the hostile approach to immigration favoured by his predecessor, Theresa May.\n",
      "\n",
      "Foreign students could stay for two years after their studies until 2012, when Mrs May, then the home secretary, introduced the current limit in an attempt to cut net migration. Mr Johnson’s government is “explicitly moving away from the focus on reducing numbers,” says Robert McNeil of the Migration Observatory at Oxford University. The new policy is also significantly more liberal than that recommended by the government’s independent migration advisory committee.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is good news for universities. Britain has long been a destination of choice for foreign students, thanks to tuition in English and the cachet of its institutions. Though it remains the second-most favoured destination (see chart), it has lost market share in recent years. Indians, in particular, have switched to countries with more generous options for post-study work. Foreign students already account for a fifth of places in Britain. The relaxed rules should tempt many more of them.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vice-chancellors are especially keen on students from outside the European Union, who pay the full cost of their degree, rather than the £9,250 ($11,400) per year that universities can charge Britons and other Europeans. The number of Asian students looking to study abroad is booming, thanks to growing wealth and connectedness. The British government hopes to increase the number of foreign students from about 450,000 to 600,000 by 2030.\n",
      "\n",
      "Employers are cock-a-hoop, too. The current rules leave them a brief window to find good graduates to sponsor or risk them going home. The new scheme gives firms and graduates the time to “try before you buy”, says Ian Robinson of Fragomen, a law firm. The overall impact on the labour market will be slight, since only 40,000 or so students a year took up the two-year period before it was abolished. But it will give firms a bigger pool of workers with desirable skills. Far more international students plump for business or engineering degrees than courses in history or philosophy.\n",
      "\n",
      "And the policy is the most significant attempt yet by a Leaver to follow through on the commitment to create an outward-looking “global Britain” after Brexit. Exporting education boosts Britain’s soft power around the world. More heads of state and government (58) were educated in Britain than in any other country, according to a study in 2017 by the Higher Education Policy Institute, a think-tank. As Brexit roils the country, at least there are some lessons Britain can still teach. ■\n",
      "N came bearing gifts. The Brexit Party, jogging along at about 14% in the polls, would step aside for the Conservatives in seats across the country, provided the Tories backed a no-deal exit from the European Union, he proposed. The price? The Conservatives would have to give Mr Farage’s party a free run at 80-90 seats in the Midlands and the north, where the Leave vote was strong but residual antipathy to the Tories is stronger. “Does Boris have the courage?” read the kicker of a wraparound advert by the Brexit Party on the front page of the Daily Express on September 11th.\n",
      "\n",
      "Downing Street quickly slapped down the idea. The Brexit Party leader and his ilk “should never be allowed anywhere near government”, declared one senior Tory source. Pacts in British politics tend to come to naught. Yet rumblings about a deal will continue until an election is called. The Independence Party, Mr Farage’s old outfit, came second in 120 constituencies in 2015, with 12.6% of the vote. If current polls bear out, the Brexit Party’s performance could determine the winner of the next election.\n",
      "\n",
      "The rarity of pacts in British politics is in some ways surprising. After all, they can work. In a by-election in Brecon and Radnorshire in August, a Liberal Democrat beat the Conservative candidate by 1,400 votes, after the Green Party and Plaid Cymru, which had won 3,000 votes between them in 2015, sat it out. The Brexit Party would have comfortably won a by-election in Peterborough in June if the Conservative Party had stood aside. Instead, Labour squeaked home by 683 votes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Political tie-ups do not come easily. s, aides and activists spend all day plotting against other parties. Asking them to work together for a few months before an election is not natural. Campaigners fear that sitting out one election will leave them playing catch-up in the next one. Mr Farage is heartily disliked by Dominic Cummings, chief adviser to the prime minister, who sees the Brexit Party leader as political kryptonite for middle-class voters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pacts also come with big risks. First-past-the-post generously rewards the two largest parties, providing a big incentive for Labour and the Conservatives to stamp out smaller challengers, lest they end up usurping them. Nor is teaming up with another party risk-free for the smaller entity. After the Lib Dems entered a coalition with the Conservatives in 2010, voters rewarded them by kicking out all but eight of their 56 s at the next election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Party pride and political practicality leave tactical voting as the most viable way for parties to work together against a common enemy. In 1997, tactical voting by Labour and Lib Dem supporters cost the Conservatives about 30 seats, points out Peter Kellner, a pollster. This year, with polls predicting a close-run election, a handful of seats may determine the fate of the country. Well-organised campaigns that back staying in the are preparing a propaganda onslaught aimed at making Remain supporters back the right horse, just as Mr Farage is attempting to corral Leave voters into one camp.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all in the Conservative Party are resistant to Mr Farage’s charms. The Brexit Party leader has already promised not to field candidates against the self-styled “Spartans”, Conservative s who opposed the Brexit deal all three times it was put before the Commons. The concern of those hardline Tory s is leaving the , rather than the electoral health of the Conservative Party—better a Brexit Party with their heart set on a “no-deal” Brexit than a Tory candidate who might compromise. An unofficial pact, with Conservative candidates playing dead in certain no-hope constituencies, is possible, suggest Tory aides. This would help the party to limit its loss of support among liberal Conservatives, who would blanch at a formal deal with the likes of Mr Farage.\n",
      "\n",
      "But parties that want a second referendum on Brexit, such as Labour and the Greens, or to cancel it altogether, like the Lib Dems, can do the same. This has happened before. In 2017, Labour and Lib Dem activists did not tread on each other’s toes in three marginal seats on the Sussex coast. The unofficial tactics worked: the Conservatives lost all of them. Britain is roughly equally split into two tribes, one which supported Brexit and one which opposed it. The outcome of the next election will be decided by which tribe can marshal its members in the most efficient way.■\n",

      "I you are driving a car during a torrential downpour. You hit a puddle and start to aquaplane. Some drivers would instinctively slam on the brakes. But some petrolheads claim that the best course of action is to accelerate out of trouble. Make the wrong decision and your car could end up skidding off the road.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Bank of England may soon face a similar dilemma. In the event that Britain leaves the European Union with nothing agreed, should it raise or lower interest rates? Shortly after the referendum in 2016 the bank cut the base rate of interest and launched a round of quantitative easing (printing money to buy bonds). But now it argues that “[t]he monetary-policy response to Brexit, whatever form it takes …could be in either direction.” On September 19th the bank is expected to keep rates at 0.75% for the 14th month running. It may also offer some clues about what it would do if the storm of a no-deal Brexit swept over Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "One impact of no-deal would be to damage the demand side of the economy (ie, how much stuff people want to buy). Worries about the future would prompt households to trim their spending. Unemployment might start to rise. Companies would postpone or cancel their investment plans. By cutting interest rates, the bank would lower the cost of borrowing and make saving less rewarding, thereby helping to stimulate demand.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, rate-setters have less room for manoeuvre than they did after the referendum. Back in mid-2016, consumer prices were growing at 0.5% a year. Now the inflation rate is slightly above the bank’s 2% target. Following a no-deal Brexit, sterling would almost certainly fall, further pushing up prices as imports became more expensive. A depreciation of 10% or more in the value of the pound is likely—which, according to a rule of thumb, would increase prices by 2-3%. All else equal, that calls for tighter monetary policy.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another reason why bringing out the playbook from 2016 would be tricky. The referendum did not change anything fundamental about the British economy. All laws and regulations in place on June 24th 2016, the day after the vote, were the same as they had been on June 23rd. A no-deal Brexit would be different. Britain’s trading relationship with its biggest market would change overnight. The imposition of non-tariff barriers would make it more difficult to do business with the market. Ports would gum up.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shock to the supply side of the economy (ie, what it can produce) could be inflationary. In a speech in 2017 Ben Broadbent, a member of the bank’s monetary-policy committee ( ), suggested that with the European market less accessible, British households and firms might try to source products closer to home. They might buy British cheese, say, instead of the foreign stuff. But domestic producers would not be able to satisfy all that extra demand right away. Faced with more customers for their wares, they might simply raise their prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "The bank must balance these competing pressures. In the past it has tolerated above-target inflation for a short while, the better to support economic growth and jobs. Mark Carney, the bank’s governor and chairman of the , told a committee of s on September 4th that “it is more likely that I would vote to ease policy in the event of a no-deal Brexit than not.” But, he added, “It is not assured.” Other members of the sound even more cautious. Most probably the bank would treat the British economy the way that you should treat an aquaplaning car—neither stepping too hard on the gas nor slamming on the brakes. Anyone looking for radical measures to save the British economy from the consequences of a no-deal Brexit is likely to be disappointed. ■\n",
      "T powerful tool at the political journalist’s disposal is the lunch invitation. You take a senior politician out to an expensive restaurant in the hope that good food and hot gossip will loosen the ministerial tongue. This was easier in the days when politicians frequently drank at lunch—and some drank a lot—but remains a stock-in-trade even in these abstemious times.\n",
      "\n",
      "This columnist recently tried a revolutionary tactic: having lunch with real people rather than politicos. His companions were a small group of Leavers one day and a slightly larger group of Remainers two days later. The first lunch took place in a riverside pub on the border of the Runnymede and Weybridge constituency, in London’s commuter belt (Bagehot paid). The second took place in a comfortable kitchen in Vauxhall, in the inner-London gentrification belt (Bagehot sponged). There was nothing scientific about any of this lunching—the groups were assembled on the basis of chance acquaintance rather than psephological profiling. But the encounters nevertheless suggest answers to two pressing questions: how are the tribes organising themselves? And why do they feel so strongly about Brexit?\n",
      "\n",
      "The groups had some striking things in common. They have both been radicalised by the European question. For the Leavers, radicalisation began with the Maastricht debates of the early 1990s. For the Remainers, it started with the referendum of 2016. Both groups are now super-charged. One Leaver says he is returning to referendum mode and working “24/7”. A Remainer says he is in Parliament Square “all the time”, despite having a full-time job.\n",
      "\n",
      "Engagement with Brexit has coincided with disengagement from established politics. The Leavers have all quit the Conservative Party, largely because of its dithering over Europe, but also because David Cameron severed the party from its roots. All but one of the Remainers have left the Labour Party, because of the rise of Jeremy Corbyn and his “ill-disguised support for Brexit”. Abandonment has been hastened by the fact that their local s are batting for the other side. Kate Hoey, Vauxhall’s Labour , is a Leaver, while Philip Hammond, Weybridge’s , backed Remain and is a leading Tory rebel.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both groups have little time for mainstream media—not just because it is biased (pro-Leave or pro-Remain, according to where you stand), but also because it is unnecessary. Modern technology means you can do it all yourself. Members of both groups constantly share articles that catch their attention. They pore over official reports, forwarding them approvingly if they agree with them or with forensic comments if they don’t. They also create their own media. The Remainers have recently posted a series of videos designed to highlight the practical pitfalls of leaving.\n",
      "\n",
      "The biggest similarity between the groups is that they are both very upset. “I’m not political,” says one Brexiteer, “I’m just angry.” The Remainers reject the word “angry” and highlight other emotions: “determined”, “bereaved”, “panic-stricken”, “scared”. “I feel upended,” says one. “Everything I am is being challenged.” What is it about the European issue that arouses such strong emotions in people who are enjoying such enviable lives?\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Leavers, the most emotive subject is democracy. They say they became involved in Brexit politics because they worried that the European Union was a fundamentally anti-democratic project, determined to hand power to unelected elites and reduce Parliament to the status of a borough council. Their involvement was deepened when the elites decided to subvert the result of the referendum by watering it down (Theresa May’s strategy) or reversing it completely (via a “People’s Vote”). The Remainers have broken the fundamental principle of losers’ consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the Remainers, the most emotive issue is deceit. They think the Leavers lied their way to victory by putting inflated numbers on the side of a bus and feeding misleading ads into Facebook. There is a lot of talk about Vladimir Putin and “malign external influences”. They also believe that a bigger lie is involved. A cabal of ultra-Thatcherites is using Brexit to tear up the social contract and turn Britain into a “ -style dog-eat-dog dystopia”.\n",
      "\n",
      "But again there are striking similarities in what motivates Leavers and Remainers. One regards control. The Leavers think that you need to assert sovereignty in order to regain control of your destiny. Weybridge has suffered serious shortages of doctors, school places and housing because of an influx of eastern Europeans which, thanks to free movement, the country cannot control. The Remainers think you need to be able to pool sovereignty into a larger entity in order to combat global companies, particularly American internet giants.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second similarity is a vision of England. For most of the people gathered in the pub or around the kitchen table, the issue is not so much Europe as Britain. The Leavers think that a country which pioneered parliamentary government and individual rights is becoming a “slave state to the ” (they repeatedly point out that the Magna Carta was signed at Runnymede, in their constituency). The Remainers think that a country which embodied the principles of humanity and generosity in the post-war welfare state is being vandalised. “Our sense of what it is to be British—fair play, decency, compassion for the poor—is being challenged.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The existence of groups like these across the country makes the result of the next election unusually hard to predict. Both tribes are much more interested in Brexit than in anything else. Both are self-organising entities with their own networks and newsfeeds. And both are adamantine in their commitment. The Leavers are perhaps the wildest card in an election of wild cards. They have time on their hands, thanks to retirement, and sophisticated national networks, thanks to Silicon Valley. The youth-obsessed media ignores the power of these greying activists at its peril. ■\n"

      "I for European diplomats to become obsessed with British constitutional niceties. But recently they have watched Westminster with rare attention—and growing concern. Some gloat over the chaos of Boris Johnson’s government, after it lost six Commons votes, its parliamentary majority, a clutch of Tory s and two ministers. Yet many are also alarmed by Mr Johnson’s bullheaded insistence on leaving the on October 31st, “do or die”, meaning deal or no-deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "One example concerns the new law requiring Mr Johnson to seek the ’s agreement to extend the Brexit deadline rather than accept no-deal. His claim that he would rather be “dead in a ditch” than do this is seen as a threat to the rule of law. A second is the early suspension of Parliament, which many believe was done solely to avoid further scrutiny of the government by the legislature. On September 9th Scotland’s highest court seemed to endorse this view by ruling that Mr Johnson’s advice to the queen to suspend Parliament so that he could prepare a new legislative agenda was unlawful—in effect, accusing the prime minister of misleading the monarch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government is appealing against the judgment to the Supreme Court, which will hear the case next week with appeals from similar cases in England and Northern Ireland. The English judgment was that suspension was a political not a justiciable issue, and the Supreme Court may well agree. Some lawyers suggest it could even endorse both judgments, because Scottish law differs from English law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claims that Mr Johnson has misled the queen reverberate in Brussels. Next week marks 30 days since Mr Johnson met Germany’s Angela Merkel, who seemed to set this deadline for finding an alternative to the Irish backstop that the prime minister wants to excise from Theresa May’s withdrawal agreement. Yet no British proposal has been made.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr Johnson met Leo Varadkar in Dublin this week, he claimed to be working for a deal and called no-deal a “failure of statecraft”. His government’s “Yellowhammer” analysis of no-deal, published on September 11th, talks of possible food, fuel and medicine shortages, lorry tailbacks and the risk of civil disorder. But the taoiseach insisted that no backstop would mean no-deal, adding that it was impossible to replace a legal guarantee of no hard border in Ireland with a mere promise.\n",
      "\n",
      "Diplomats report that twice-weekly talks are now taking place with Mr Johnson’s adviser, David Frost. In late August there was even talk of adjusting the backstop by narrowing it to agrifoods or setting a time limit. The would also happily apply the backstop only to Northern Ireland, not the whole . A Northern Ireland-only backstop was originally in Mrs May’s deal. It was replaced by a -wide backstop because the Democratic Unionist Party, which propped up her majority, insisted on no new border checks in the Irish Sea. Since Mr Johnson now has no parliamentary majority, the is in a weaker position. Some of Mr Johnson’s advisers want to revert to a Northern Ireland-only backstop.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the has hardened its position on Brexit, for three reasons. The first is that Mr Johnson has added new demands. He wants to drop promises to maintain a level playing field for regulations and distance Britain from future defence co-operation. These promises are in the political declaration about the future relationship, not the withdrawal agreement, but backing away from them still sends an unwelcome signal. The is clear that, without level-playing-field guarantees, it cannot offer a Canada-style free-trade deal to Britain for fear of being competitively undercut.\n",
      "\n",
      "Second is Mr Johnson’s loss of parliamentary control. Just as with Mrs May earlier this year, negotiators fret that any concession they may offer will still see the Brexit deal rejected in Westminster. They have noticed that s are better at saying what they are against than what they are for. They know many Tory s oppose Mrs May’s withdrawal agreement even without the backstop. And they see a rising prospect of an early election that Mr Johnson is by no means certain to win.\n",
      "\n",
      "Third is the law to force the prime minister to seek an extension if no deal is reached by October 19th. For all Mr Johnson’s threats to ignore it, leaders expect that, without an agreed deal, they will indeed be asked to extend the deadline. And although many are fed up with Brexit and would need a good reason for yet another extension, nobody is likely to veto one, if only because the wants to avoid any blame for no-deal. For the same reason, suggestions that Mr Johnson might scupper an extension by threatening to behave badly, refusing to nominate a commissioner or asking a friendly leader to block one, are unlikely to prove correct. If no-deal happens, the wants it to be clear that it is by British choice, not by necessity.\n",
      "\n",
      "A similar argument is heard against Mr Johnson’s repeated claims that the will give him what he wants only at the last minute if he credibly threatens no-deal. The does not function with a gun at its head, says one diplomat, adding that in this case the gun is anyway pointed at Mr Johnson himself. It is true that nobody wants no-deal, which would damage European exporters as well as Britain. But leaders value even more the interests of Ireland, the integrity of the single market and the laws underpinning it, and the need not to be seen giving in to bullying.\n",
      "\n",
      "What will happen when the European Council meets in Brussels on October 17th? It seems clear that there will not be a British election beforehand, so leaders know they will be facing Mr Johnson for the first (and, some hope, last) time. Some diplomats fear that he might produce a proposal only at the meeting in hopes of bouncing the summit into agreement rather than risk a no-deal outcome. Yet without proper preparation, summits are not good places to conduct detailed negotiations. Instead, the leaders are likely to offer to extend the October 31st deadline to the end of January—and then wait for an election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson’s team still insists Brexit will happen on October 31st. Yet a deal is a long way off. And Parliament’s intervention means a no-deal Brexit then also looks unlikely. The prime minister seems to want to fight an election in which he styles himself as the champion of the people against an anti-Brexit establishment, a category into which Brexiteers now lump the courts, along with Parliament, the civil service, the Bank of England and others.\n",
      "\n",
      "He may win on such a platform, although the polls are volatile. But if he does, he will face the same demands in Brussels. Only if he comes up with a credible, legal alternative to the Irish backstop that can pass in Westminster will he get a Brexit deal. It will still be a tall order. ■\n",
      "O Monday morning Terminal 5, Heathrow airport’s busiest, is a hive of activity. Over 100,000 passengers arrive or leave for more than 150 destinations. But on September 9th its departure halls were almost completely abandoned. The only flights taking off were to Cairo, Madrid and Tokyo. The reason was a two-day strike by British Airways ( ) pilots and their union, the British Airline Pilots’ Association ( ). The walkout, which grounded almost 1,700 flights due to carry at least 280,000 people, was the first ever pilot strike at . threatens more—on September 27th and then other dates stretching until January. But far from showing the growing clout of pilots��� unions, their battle for better pay exposes their rapidly weakening position.\n",
      "\n",
      "At first glance, it would seem that ’s pilots have little to complain about. In July they rejected a pay deal which would have increased their salaries by 11.5% over three years—more than average pay in Britain is forecast to rise over the period—and which would have taken the annual pay of a long-haul captain to over £200,000 ($248,000).\n",
      "\n",
      "But says its pilots also want a share of ’s profits. During the last recession, in 2008-09, its members accepted a 2.6% pay cut and saw some extra allowances slashed when times were tough. So now says its pilots deserve to benefit from the carrier’s more recent success. After losing £531m in 2010, swallowed Aer Lingus, Iberia and Vueling, and since 2014 the combined group, , has made more profit in absolute terms than any other European airline group. ’s announcement in February that it made record profits of €2.9bn ($3.2bn) last year was a red rag to ’s bulls.\n",
      "\n",
      "’s refusal to budge on pay has puzzled analysts. claims the two sides were just £5m a year apart when the talks collapsed. claims the last-minute proposal put forward to avoid the strikes would have cost it £50m a year. But even that looks something of a bargain compared with the cost of the strikes. Alex Cruz, ’s chief executive, has admitted that the cancelled flights will “punish the brand”. Damian Brewer, an airline analyst at Capital Markets, estimates that each day of strikes will cost €50m.\n",
      "\n",
      "is not the only airline with which is in dispute. Ryanair, Europe’s largest low-cost carrier, is also feeling its pilots’ new-found assertiveness keenly. In 2017 it was forced to recognise unions for the first time, after a shortage of pilots had forced it to cancel 20,000 flights that autumn. And this summer it has been hit by a long run of industrial action. Last month its British pilots called five days of strikes, and on September 4th they announced seven more days of walkouts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the rapid growth of Europe’s airline industry, which created the shortage of pilots that unions are trying to exploit, is coming to an end. In each of the past four years global passenger numbers grew by 7% or more. But in the first half of 2019 the rate fell to around 3.5% because of slowing economic growth and the grounding of Boeing’s 737 planes, due to safety problems. Ryanair and Norwegian, a low-cost rival, have now hired and trained too many pilots, and in Britain are trying to lay off hundreds of them. Several European airlines have gone bust over the past year, including Air of Iceland, Flybmi of Britain and Primera Air of Latvia, leaving lots of pilots scrambling to find work. Last month Ryanair announced that pilot turnover had “dwindled to zero”—a clear sign that an employees’ market had become an employers’ one.\n",

      "Unfortunately for passengers, that is unlikely to bring a swift resolution to and Ryanair’s disputes. wants to get as good a deal as it can for its members before the glut of pilots gets worse. And Mr Cruz is worried that if he gives in to the pilots, cabin crew and ground staff could start making similar demands. With increasingly sluggish demand for air travel and a possible no-deal Brexit threatening to dent profits over the next year, he wants to defend his margins. Passengers should buckle up for more disruption. ■\n"

Yet late on Saturday Mr Johnson suffered a new setback: the first resignation from his cabinet. Amber Rudd, the work and pensions secretary, quit both the cabinet and the Conservative Party.

More damaging still was her criticism of his Brexit policy. Mr Johnson claims that he wants to get a new and improved exit deal from the European Union, and that Britain will leave with no deal only if that approach fails. Yet Ms Rudd seems to have reached the conclusion that the government’s negotiations are insincere, and that no-deal is where it is really heading. “I no longer believe leaving with a deal is the government's main objective,” she writes. She is quitting not just the cabinet but the party, which she complains has been stripped of broad-minded MPs.\n",
      "\n",
      "All eyes will now be on other moderate members of the cabinet. Most have said in the past that they want to get a Brexit deal and that leaving with no-deal should be only a last resort. They will have seen the same evidence as Ms Rudd in cabinet, and have read the same recent reports that Mr Johnson’s chief adviser Dominic Cummings privately admits the government’s negotiations in Brussels are “sham”. Most of them have also previously strongly condemned the idea of suspending Parliament in order to stop MPs debating Brexit, only to see Mr Johnson do just that this week. Will they continue to stand by?\n",
      "\n",
      "For Mr Johnson, more pain lies ahead. On Monday a bill forcing him to request an extension of the Brexit negotiating period, beyond the October 31st deadline, is expected to become law. The government is desperate to call an election ahead of this date, to give it the chance to overturn the legislation. Yet on Monday it is expected to lose a vote required for such an election to take place. Labour and other opposition parties say they want an election only after the Brexit deadline has been extended. They hope to humiliate Mr Johnson by forcing him to beg the EU for more time, something he has repeatedly vowed never to do. The prime minister is reportedly toying with ignoring the extension bill, thus defying the law.\n",
      "\n",
      "Tories comfort themselves with the fact that, in spite of their shocking week, they remain well ahead in the polls. Surveys out this weekend have the Conservatives some ten points in front of Labour, whose far-left leader, Jeremy Corbyn, is much less liked than Mr Johnson. The prime minister seems to be in campaign mode, expecting an election soon, even if he has to wait longer for one than he might like. His supporters insist that this week’s run of dreadful stories are of interest only to those in the Westminster bubble, and that ordinary voters couldn’t care less whether the likes of Ms Rudd are in the cabinet or not. They may well be right, for now. But as Mr Johnson continues to bleed support among his backbenchers, his cabinet and even his family, the question must be how long he can keep the support of the public.\n",
      "I voice about to be heard at last? In the Brexit referendum of 2016, fully 62% of Scots backed Remain. To no avail—England’s vastly greater size ensured that a narrow majority for Leave in the south dictated Britain’s exit from the European Union. Since then, Scotland’s politicians have largely played the role of bystanders as the Conservatives and Labour in Westminster have scrapped with each other, and between themselves, for control of the Brexit agenda. Scotland’s influence, so heavily felt in the cabinets of Margaret Thatcher and Tony Blair, has waned sharply.\n",
      "\n",
      "The arrival of Boris Johnson in 10 Downing Street suggests that a strain of English nationalism, embraced by Mr Johnson in an attempt to see off the threat of Nigel Farage and his Brexit Party, is to play a prominent role in Tory thinking. This has proved too much for Ruth Davidson, the popular leader of Scotland’s Conservatives, who last week announced her departure.\n",
      "\n",
      "In her resignation speech on August 29th Ms Davidson stressed the pressure that political leadership has placed on her family (she recently returned from maternity leave) more than any conflict with her Westminster colleagues. But her personal relationship with Mr Johnson has long been poor, and her brand of liberal Conservatism—she regularly cites Sir John Major, prime minister in 1990-97, as a touchstone—is suddenly unfashionable. Any possibility that she might unseat Nicola Sturgeon, first minister and leader of the Scottish National Party , at the next election to the devolved parliament in 2021, was becoming slimmer by the day.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet her departure carries significant danger for the Conservative Party on both sides of the border. Under her eight-year leadership, driven by her distinctive energy, forthrightness and wit, the Scottish Tories returned from the electoral dead. In 2011, the year she took over, they had 15 seats in the Scottish Parliament and one at Westminster. She leaves the party as the official opposition at Holyrood, with 31 seats, and with 13 seats at Westminster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson needs those Westminster seats to stay blue in the general election that is expected to be called soon. In the election of 2017, a disastrous night for the Tories in England, the strong showing of the Scottish Conservatives was crucial to keeping the party in government. But the Tory roots in those Scottish seats are shallow, and the margin of victory last time mostly nothing to write home about. A majority of voters backed Remain in all but one of them. In Stirling, for example, where an majority of 10,480 in 2015 gave way to a Conservative majority of 148 in 2017, only about a third voted Leave. The Tories would lose ten of their 13 seats to the if there were an election, according to a YouGov poll for the Times on September 4th.\n",
      "\n",
      "It is not just Mr Johnson’s government that is at stake, but the future of the union itself. Ms Davidson has been the main pro-British figure in Scotland since the independence referendum of 2014. She redesigned her party to make it more palatable to Scots, and reaped the electoral benefits. Her departure is a huge boost to Ms Sturgeon, who hopes to secure a second independence referendum within a few years and who will regard winning it as eminently more achievable in the absence of her erstwhile opponent.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Davidson’s successor matters, therefore. Scottish Tory insiders expect a run-off between a pro-Brexit, pro-Johnson candidate (possibly Jackson Carlaw, Ms Davidson’s deputy), who might wrap himself in a union flag and prove popular with party members, and a candidate who argues for more distance and autonomy from the English party, such as Murdo Fraser, who is likely to be favoured by Tory members of the Scottish Parliament. The outcome will determine the shape of Scottish politics for years to come—and perhaps the survival or otherwise of the union. ■\n",
      "W food riots start, says Linda, a university administrator from Brighton, “I plan to watch them on enjoying a nice puttanesca whipped up from the Brexit cupboard.” Often included on no-deal-Brexit recipe lists, the fiery pasta dish from Naples requires nothing fresh. From her stash of tins and frozen veg, Linda is self-sufficient for up to three weeks. Stockpilers are seen as a bit crackers, but the chance of a disorderly exit from the European Union is prompting more people to take precautions.\n",
      "\n",
      "One survey in August by , a shopper-research firm, found that 61% of consumers expect Brexit-related food shortages. Nearly a third of people plan to stockpile and 14% are already doing so. Anecdotal evidence of hoarding is plentiful. A manager of a big Waitrose store in London says he has seen a rise in purchases of tins and frozen veg. Does he, a supermarket insider, plan to stockpile? “Absolutely,” comes the answer. Shoppers who have done no hoarding plan to go into panic-buying mode later if no-deal stays on the cards.\n",
      "\n",
      "The government’s “Get ready for Brexit” campaign, launched this week by Michael Gove, the minister in charge of preparing for no-deal, will spur them on (though the associated website makes no mention of provisioning, focusing on health certificates for -bound pets, not what to do if the dog food runs out).\n",
      "\n",
      "But the food industry has driven home the relevant facts. Britain imports between two-fifths and half of its food, mostly from the . That supply could be halved because 50% of lorries coming from Calais into Dover are expected to get blocked by border checks and traffic chaos, says Tim Rycroft of the Food & Drink Federation, which represents giant food manufacturers. There are plans to fly in vital medicines, but not food.\n",
      "\n",
      "Stockpiling groups are aware of the risk of exacerbating shortages. A prominent, 10,960-strong Facebook group, 48% Preppers—a reference to the share of people who voted Remain in 2016—has stopped talking publicly about its activities. Jo Elgarf, an administrator, explains that it is now too late to stock up bit by bit. “Anything now will be panic.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor are stockpilers all nervy Remoaners. Zoe, an entrepreneur from Lewes, wants a no-deal Brexit and believes in self-reliance. She is using her five acres to raise animals for meat to supply family, friends and neighbours through any disruption. She has pigs booked into an abattoir in the first week of October—it takes time to process the meat. “I was gutted when we didn’t leave in March,” she says. “I was so prepared.”■\n"

      "T no public toilets in Bartley Green, a neighbourhood on the fringes of Birmingham. Caught short, your correspondent begs for relief at a funeral parlour. The question is asked so often at the dentist’s next door that a sign forbids passers-by from spending a penny. “That’s one of the things we don’t have round here,” says the undertaker. It is not the only thing. Several shops are boarded up; the library opens only two days a week. One of the few places with a buzz is a bus shelter on the main road. “Everything’s a bus away,” groans one resident, queuing for the number 18. “There’s nothing here.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Few things in politics are as fashionable as unfashionable places. The Brexit referendum and Donald Trump’s election sent journalists on both sides of the Atlantic scurrying to the margins of Britain and America, in search of the source of disaffection. Academics are making careers interpreting the whims of people who live there. In his first speech as prime minister, Boris Johnson promised to answer “the plea of the forgotten people and the left-behind towns”. On September 5th, Oxford Consultants for Social Inclusion ( ), a group of wonks for hire, added some welcome crunch to the rhetoric with a new measure of England’s “left-behind” places.\n",
      "\n",
      "already compiles the index of multiple deprivation, an official ranking that combines different measures of quality of life. But Local Trust, a charity, asked to devise a community-needs index with a narrower focus. Whereas the multiple-deprivation index largely assesses the presence of negative factors like crime and unemployment, the new index highlights the absence of positives, such as civic amenities and transport links. Stefan Noble of defines left-behind places as local-authority wards that fall within the first decile of both indices. Of England’s 7,433 wards, 206 fit that bill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Much of the list is unsurprising. Many of the poorest-performing wards are concentrated in post-industrial parts of the country or unloved seaside towns. About 13% of wards in the north-east are classed as left-behind, the country’s highest rate. More interesting is the presence on the list of plenty of housing estates on the fringes of prosperous cities and large towns. They are only a short drive or bus ride from thriving city centres and yet feel neglected. “Public transport outside of London is expensive,” says Mr Noble. “It is difficult for people to leave these areas and participate in the core.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Left-behind places are less diverse, with a much greater proportion of white residents than other deprived areas and England as a whole. They are also growing more slowly. On average, their populations rose by 5% in 2001-17, compared with 12% in all of England and 17% in other deprived areas. And they are struggling for jobs. Before the financial crash of 2008, the unemployment rate was lower in these wards than in other deprived places. But it has been higher ever since, and is now double the national average.\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps the most intriguing finding concerns Brexit. There is a strong association between a ward’s position on the new index and its vote to leave. The correlation is more than three times stronger than that between the Leave vote and the conventional deprivation-index ranking. This could bolster the argument of those who reckon cultural and social factors—as much as economic ones—determine people’s satisfaction with the status quo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bartley Green is typical. It is only six miles from central Birmingham but the bus journey takes at least half an hour. Buses have been cut and there are two pubs where once there were six, says John Lines, a councillor. Laura Smith was a youth worker until her job was axed. Now, she says, “there’s nothing for the kids”. Her disabled daughter is due to start at school this week, but she is still waiting for a place on the bus to be confirmed. “If we have to take taxis, it’s £30 [$37] a day.” Only 27% of voters turned out in the last local election. In the Brexit referendum, two-thirds voted Leave.\n",
      "\n",
      "The data do not capture everything. In Bartley Green, volunteers have enabled the library to expand from opening one day a week to two days. They run coffee mornings and sewing classes and use social media to encourage the isolated to join in. In the Henley ward of Coventry, another left-behind place, locals were so riled by the negative publicity of their billing on the multiple-deprivation index that they made a calendar with pictures of their community groups, like armchair exercise classes for the elderly. Such places might lack many amenities that other Britons take for granted, but they are not short of pride. ■\n",
      "“T HE OH, OH , Ohhh-lympics!” ran one tabloid headline. “As record 150,000 condoms are handed out to a host of super-attractive athletes, could London 2012 be the raunchiest games ever?” Official statistics regarding the sex lives of toned athletes are hard to find. But away from the Olympic village, another reproductive record was indeed broken that year. According to the Office for National Statistics ( ), mothers in England and Wales gave birth to 729,674 children, the most in over four decades. They have struggled to keep up since (see chart).\n",
      "\n",
      "The boom followed a bust. Births began to slump during the 1990s, reaching a low of 594,634 in 2001. The subsequent growth reflected a number of factors (none actually related to the hosting of sports events). There was an echo of earlier baby booms, which increased the number of women of child-bearing age. This coincided with a rise in fertility rates, partly because of more births among older women, who had earlier postponed them. The average maternal age at birth is now 31, up from 28 two decades ago.\n",
      "\n",
      "And then there was an increase in immigration. A paper by the estimates that foreign-born mothers accounted for two-thirds of the rise in births between 2001 and 2007. In 2000, 16% of children born in England and Wales had mothers who had been born abroad; by 2012, 26% did. An influx of youngish eastern European migrants after the expansion of the European Union in 2004 contributed to the boom. In 2010 Polish mothers overtook Pakistanis to become the largest group of foreign mums. Polish and Romanian mothers now account for more than 5% of births in Britain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Changes in population always cause “stomach aches” for the welfare state, notes David Coleman of the University of Oxford. Predicting exactly when birth rates will pick up or slow down is difficult, because it depends on a range of factors from house prices to cultural expectations. But governments, both local and national, are forced to guess, since it takes years to build, say, a school. Another dilemma, notes Piers Elias, a consultant who advises councils on demography, is that local authorities must decide whether to prepare for the peak population, which is more expensive and may later result in empty buildings, or the average, which will lead to a squeeze during the busiest years.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maternity services were the first to be put under pressure—initially by the rise in the number of births, then by the increasing age of mothers, which results in more complications. The average class size in primary schools has since risen to 27.1, up from 26.4 in 2010. And a bumper crop of 11-year-olds is now heading into secondary schools, which tend to struggle with higher numbers more than primary schools because of the difficulty of attracting specialist teachers, particularly in subjects like maths and physics, says Jon Andrews of the Education Policy Institute ( ), a think-tank. In a spending statement on September 4th the government confirmed that it would give schools another £4.6bn ($5.6bn) by 2022-23, a 10% increase. According to the ’s estimates, nearly £1bn of that will be sucked up by the extra pupils.\n",
      "\n",
      "Being part of a boom generation is something of a curse. Resources are spread more thinly and competition for them is more intense. This year secondary schools are likelier to be oversubscribed than in past years, because of the abundance of 11-year-olds. In contrast, universities are currently going to desperate lengths to attract students, owing to a shortage of 18-year-olds. By the time the Olympic generation come to apply, in a decade or so, it will probably be harder to get in. And things will not get any easier after that. When they head into the workplace they will face a truly Olympian task: supporting the even bigger generation of boomers who will be enjoying retirement. ■\n"

      "S events are happening in British politics that it is impossible to tell the normal from the abnormal. This is not only disorientating—all the talk of “coups” and “traitors” can unsettle even the most philosophical of souls. It is also dangerous. A quick glance at history shows that terrible things can happen when you normalise the abnormal. Jacob Rees-Mogg, the leader of the House of Commons, maintains that the British constitution can “bend to a passing storm”. But if the storm is a hurricane that rages on for years, it can also break.\n",

      "Boris Johnson was elected over his more moderate rival, Jeremy Hunt, with 93,000 votes out of a turnout of just 150,000—all that remains of a Conservative Party that was once 3m strong. More than half are over 55 years old, 70% are men, 97% are white and, as a group, they have far more authoritarian and Eurosceptic views than the population at large. Yet this mockery of a mandate has not prevented Mr Johnson from pursuing an unbendingly extreme policy. He has filled his cabinet with people willing to sign up to a no-deal Brexit, a minority position in the parliamentary party. He has suspended Parliament in order to reduce the amount of time available to debate the rights and wrongs of such a Brexit, a decision that many regard as a constitutional outrage. His justification for this is that the “will of the people”, as embodied in the referendum result of 2016, must be honoured. But there is no evidence that the 52% who voted for Brexit support the no-deal variety. One recent poll shows that Britons don’t trust Mr Johnson to make the right decision on Brexit by a margin of 55% to 34%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson made his second-ever appearance as prime minister in the House of Commons on September 3rd, only to suffer one of the worst humiliations of any leader. Twenty-one Tories voted with the opposition to outlaw leaving the without a deal. Mr Johnson’s response was to purge the rebels from his party. They included two former chancellors (one of whom was in office just seven weeks ago), five other former cabinet ministers and Winston Churchill’s grandson, Sir Nicholas Soames. At the same time a former Tory prime minister, Sir John Major, is party to a lawsuit accusing Mr Johnson of acting unconstitutionally.\n",
      "\n",
      "With the reality-based wing of his party decimated, Mr Johnson is a prisoner of a narrow clique that combines ideological fervour with personal eccentricity. Steve Baker talks about bulldozing the House of Commons into the Thames. John Redwood is so lacking in the milk of human kindness that he makes Mr Gradgrind look like a lactating mother. This week Mr Rees-Mogg chose to listen to an era-defining debate while lying prone across the Commons benches, as if on a chaise longue, providing the Labour Party with an ideal election poster.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even more remarkable than the mainstreaming of extremists is the normalisation of a no-deal Brexit. During the referendum campaign, no Leaver mentioned the possibility of a no-deal Brexit, just as few brought up the issue of the Irish border. Brexiteers assured the country that negotiating a trade deal with the European Union would be the easiest thing in the world. Now, Mr Johnson believes that you have to support the possibility of no-deal to remain a Tory, and Nigel Farage, the leader of the Brexit Party, regards no-deal as the only acceptable option.\n",
      "\n",
      "In normal times, voters can shift to the opposition if one side goes berserk. But the Labour Party has a good claim to have arrived ahead of the Conservative Party in crazy town, by electing Jeremy Corbyn leader. Mr Corbyn has devoted his life to supporting obscure and often repellent causes. His guests in the House of Commons have included sympathisers and Holocaust deniers. His inner circle of advisers includes a former communist, Andrew Murray, who has lauded North Korea and praised Stalin. For all the talk of his being an ineffectual party leader, Mr Corbyn has done a very good job of taking over the party’s executive committee and putting in place automatic “trigger ballots” which will allow activists to eject s who don’t toe the Corbyn line.\n",
      "\n",
      "British politics is now trapped in a weird impasse as these two extremists face each other across the aisle, bellowing and finger-jabbing. Mr Johnson, who claims that he doesn’t want an election, is now demanding one and Mr Corbyn, who claims that he does want an election, is refusing to give him one. But it is hard to summon up a laugh as events whirl out of control. Extremism is as addictive as roulette. The Conservative Party may fight the next election as a full-blown no-deal-Brexit party, forging a loose alliance with Mr Farage, and adding fury at political correctness and social breakdown to a powerful populist mix.\n",
      "\n",
      "Extremism in one party also legitimises extremism in another. If Mr Corbyn wins the next election—which is more likely than most Tories realise—he will be emboldened by the Conservatives’ recent behaviour. A Tory opposition will find it hard to accuse Mr Corbyn of sacrificing the economy on the altar of ideology when it has done exactly that. By arguing that the “will of the people” matters more than the rights of minorities or the conventions of the constitution, the Tories have supplied Mr Corbyn with the weapons he needs to push through a radical hard-left programme. All he needs is a majority, which they are doing their best to provide.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are some inspiring examples of countries righting themselves after periods of abnormality. Matteo Salvini, Italy’s fiery populist, has been weakened by his increasingly outrageous behaviour. But with both parties controlled by fanatical factions and Britain’s uncodified constitution depending on informal rules that extremists do not respect, it is difficult to see a way out of the mess. The great test for Britain is not just whether it can leave Europe with its economy intact. It is whether it can leave without doing lasting damage to institutions that were always more delicate than either Leavers or Remainers imagined. ■\n",
      "I and your mind’s eye might conjure up Philip Hammond. The former chancellor is tall, grey and with a sense of humour that matches his fiscal policy: extra-dry. If not Mr Hammond, then perhaps a figure in the mould of Kenneth Clarke. The rotund, cigar-chomping jazz enthusiast has served in practically every senior government job bar prime minister in a 49-year stint as a Tory . Failing that, consider Sir Nicholas Soames, a former defence minister. He has a Churchillian manner, largely because Winston Churchill was his grandfather. The three embody the parliamentary Conservative Party in different ways. Yet they are no longer in it.\n",
      "\n",
      "The trio were among 21 Conservative s to have the whip withdrawn and be barred from standing for the party again after they supported a plan to make Boris Johnson, the prime minister, seek a delay to Britain’s scheduled departure from the European Union on October 31st (see next story). The purge was only the most visible part of a revolution that is transforming the world’s oldest political party. Those who advocate fiscal prudence, social liberalism and an orderly departure from the have been routed. Those who demand free-spending authoritarianism and a “do-or-die” escape from the yoke of Brussels are ascendant. ConservativeHome, a blog for party activists, described this week as “the end of the Conservative Party as we have known it”. It proved too much for even the prime minister’s brother, Jo, who resigned as an on September 5th, “torn between family loyalty and the national interest”.\n",
      "\n",
      "The revolution has required ideological flexibility from those who wish to survive it. The cabinet is full of s who are historically small-state Conservatives. Four of the five authors of “Britannia Unchained”, a paean to small government published by ambitious young Tory s in 2012, when fiscal austerity was in fashion, now sit in a cabinet intent on opening the public-spending taps. A spending round on September 4th included measures that will increase the size of the state as a percentage of for the first time since 2010. Sajid Javid, the chancellor, is a fan of Ayn Rand and hangs pictures of Margaret Thatcher in his office. Yet on Mr Johnson’s instructions he announced an extra £13.8bn ($16.9bn) in election-friendly giveaways, paid for with extra borrowing.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is also new thinking on law and order. Another 20,000 police officers are to be hired, and a review of whether prison sentences are too soft is expected. Priti Patel, who has called for a clampdown on immigration and once supported the return of capital punishment, is home secretary. It is a far cry from what some in the party thought Mr Johnson had in store. “Expect a liberal centrist,” advised one , who now sits in the cabinet, before Mr Johnson became prime minister. Wags have dubbed the new Tory domestic agenda: “Fund the hang the paedos.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The hardest line is on Brexit. Conservative s appreciate that they must get Britain out of the if they are to keep their seats. Yet Mr Johnson’s approach, which seems likely to end in no-deal, leaves a quiet majority of the parliamentary party uneasy. No-dealers make up only a small fraction of Tory s. A cabinet member who enthusiastically campaigned for Brexit admits that no-deal would be a catastrophe. But s are willing to serve, partly because Mr Johnson seems determined to move things forward one way or another. “They may not agree, but they are happy for the direction,” says one cabinet minister.\n",
      "\n",
      "Setting the route is Dominic Cummings, the prime minister’s chief adviser, who will not even say whether he is a member of the Conservatives. When running for office, Mr Johnson promised an inclusive, “one nation” style of government. Instead, he has set about shaking the country’s institutions, suspending Parliament for the longest period since 1945 in order to reduce the time s have to debate Brexit. Hitherto unimaginable tactics, such as asking the queen to veto anti-no-deal legislation, are now openly discussed. “This Conservative government…seems to not be very conservative, fiscally or institutionally,” noted Ryan Shorthouse of Bright Blue, a liberal Tory think-tank.\n",
      "\n",
      "The strong-arm techniques are in stark contrast to the days when David Cameron ran the party, and Eurosceptic rebels ran amok. Under Mr Johnson, such sedition is not acceptable, as this week’s purge was intended to show. Figures from Vote Leave, the main campaigning group behind the Brexit vote, call the shots in Downing Street, causing long-serving Tory s to shake their jowls at the state of affairs. Sir Roger Gale, an since 1983, declared: “You have, at the heart of Number 10, as the prime minister’s senior adviser, an unelected, foul-mouthed oaf.” A “One Nation” group of about 100 moderate Conservative s have demanded that Mr Johnson reinstate their sacked colleagues.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet for all the fury over the deselections, Mr Cummings’s strategy remains just about intact. The prime minister and his aides want an election in which Mr Johnson is portrayed as the champion of a people defied by wily politicians, with the promise of a cash tsunami about to break over Britain’s public services if people vote Tory. “He gets the election he wanted and the framing he wanted,” says one former Downing Street aide. Nor will the revolution necessarily be permanent. A socially conservative offer to voters tempted by Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party may last only until the next general election, says Tim Bale of Queen Mary University of London.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What this country needs is sensible, moderate, progressive Conservative government,” declared Mr Johnson during a stilted performance in prime minister’s questions on September 4th. Yet with the Tory party in its current state, Britain will have to wait.■\n"

By day’s end he had lost a first Commons vote against his Brexit plans by the surprisingly large margin of 27. And after the ostentatious defection of Phillip Lee, who crossed the floor to join the Liberal Democrat benches even as Mr Johnson was speaking, a rebellion by 21 other Tories had reduced his notional majority from plus one to minus 43.\n",

This claim was disbelieved by opponents, including many Tories, who say no negotiations are happening, partly because Mr Johnson has made no clear proposals to replace the backstop to avert a hard border in Ireland.\n",
      "\n",
      "If the tactic of threatening no-deal to lever concessions out of the has failed, so have attempts to bully s. Mr Johnson’s high-handed suspension of Parliament from September 9th for almost five weeks was followed by threats to reimpose discipline lost under Theresa May by deselecting Tory s who defied the whip (which Mr Johnson himself did twice earlier this year). Yet the effect was just to strengthen the rebels. In April Mrs May lost an earlier version of the Benn-Burt bill by just one vote, compared with Mr Johnson’s 27.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson responded to his defeat with characteristic belligerence. Although he conceded that he was bound to observe the law, he also said there were no circumstances in which he would ask for an extension of the October 31st deadline. The solution, he suggested, was to hold an election before then, to let the people decide who should be negotiating with the . He let it be known that October 15th was his preferred date.\n",
      "\n",
      "His problem is that, under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act ( ) of 2011, prime ministers can no longer call an election when they want. Doing so needs a two-thirds majority of s, so Mr Johnson requires Labour support. Although Mr Corbyn has long called for an election, he now insists the Benn-Burt bill to stop no-deal must become law first. Late on September 4th, a motion by Mr Johnson calling for an election duly failed because it passed with too small a majority. There are ways round the , however. A one-sentence motion calling for an election despite the act might get a simple majority. Or Mr Johnson could engineer defeat via a vote of no confidence. With his majority shot, an election seems to be coming. Can he win it?\n",
      "\n",
      "Here Mr Johnson is bullish. The latest polls give the Tories a ten-point lead over Labour. Yet elections go wrong, as Mrs May found when squandering an even bigger lead in 2017. Without a pact with Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party, which may be hard to agree, it could take Tory votes. The Tories may lose seats in Scotland, London and the south. To win a majority, they must make big gains in the midlands and north. These regions have many pro-Brexit voters, but they are by instinct anti-Tory. An election could be harder for Mr Johnson to win than some of his advisers think. ■\n",
      "AFTER A noisy and often raucous emergency Brexit debate, British MPs late on September 3rd inflicted a stunning defeat on Boris Johnson’s government. By the unexpectedly large majority of 27 votes, the House of Commons took control of the agenda for September 4th. That will allow the introduction of a bill to stop Britain leaving the European Union with no deal on October 31st. Instead the bill declares that, if the prime minister has not reached an accord with the EU by October 19th, he should ask for an extension of the Brexit deadline, initially to January 31st 2020.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson responded to his defeat with characteristic belligerence. He declared that he would propose an early election in October to decide who should represent Britain in negotiations in Brussels. He had earlier branded the bill “Jeremy Corbyn’s surrender bill”, berating the leader of the Labour opposition for siding with the EU. He threatened Conservative rebels with ejection from the party, though this did not stop as many as 21 of them defying him. Those who later had the Tory whip withdrawn include former cabinet ministers and even Sir Nicholas Soames, the grandson of Winston Churchill, Mr Johnson’s idol.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prime minister claimed that the bill would undermine his negotiating position with the EU, and he insisted there were no circumstances in which he would seek an extension of the Brexit deadline beyond October 31st. All this came after Mr Johnson announced on August 28th that Parliament would be suspended for almost five weeks from next week, giving MPs very little time in which to manoeuvre.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet Mr Johnson also accepted that he would observe the rule of law. If the planned bill becomes an act, which given the size of his defeat looks likely within days (unless the House of Lords filibusters it), he will perforce be bound by its terms. The only way to reconcile this with his refusal to seek an extension is indeed to hold an election.\n",
      "\n",
      "But Mr Johnson does not have the unilateral power to call an election. Under the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, this can be done only if two-thirds of MPs vote for it. Mr Corbyn now says the Labour opposition will not do so until the anti-no-deal bill becomes law. That will stymie Mr Johnson’s plan, at least for a while. There may be ways round the 2011 act, but it could take Mr Johnson time to find them—the more so since he has so comprehensively lost his Commons majority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nor is it certain that Mr Johnson would win an election, even if he manages to call one for October 14th, as he hopes. He has opened up a sizeable poll lead over Mr Corbyn. But he is vulnerable on his right to Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party. Mr Farage will do a pact with Mr Johnson (to avoid splitting the Brexit vote) only if the prime minister explicitly goes for no-deal, but Mr Johnson still claims he will in fact get a deal. Mr Johnson could also lose Tory seats in London, Scotland and the south-west. His predecessor, Theresa May, called an election in 2017 when she had a huge opinion-poll lead, only to finish with a hung parliament. Mr Johnson could easily do the same.\n",
      "BRITAIN’S HOUSE OF COMMONS returns to work on September 3rd for what promises to be a politically explosive week that could even presage a general election. It will start with MPs who are opposed to leaving the European Union with no deal demanding an emergency debate, which the Speaker, John Bercow, is likely to grant. They hope to use this debate to take control of the Commons agenda a day or two later, in order to pass a law demanding that the government asks the EU for another extension of the Brexit deadline rather than, as the government plans, allowing no-deal to happen by default on October 31st.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boris Johnson, the prime minister, has a working majority of just one. As many as 40 Tory rebels are publicly opposed to a no-deal Brexit. On the face of it, this suggests that a law against no-deal should have the numbers to pass. Yet Mr Johnson has not given up hopes of stopping it. In a brief statement on the steps of Downing Street on September 2nd he piled more pressure on the rebels, arguing that by trying to take no-deal off the table they are undermining his negotiating position in Brussels, where he insists he is making progress towards a better Brexit deal. And he is threatening to expel from the party any Tory MP who votes against the government, stopping them running as Tories in any election that may be called.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson has also been working to limit the parliamentary time available for any anti-no-deal law. He is suspending Parliament for almost five weeks from the middle of next week, before a planned Queen’s Speech to open a new parliamentary session on October 14th. That makes the timetable for any legislation exceptionally short. Even if a bill demanding an extension passes the Commons in a single day, as a similar one did in March, it must also pass the Lords, where it is harder to stop a filibuster by recalcitrant peers.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prime minister has two more options if MPs succeed, despite his best efforts, in passing an anti-no-deal law. The first is in effect to ignore the law, perhaps by making any request to the EU so unpalatable that it is rejected (any extension needs the unanimous support of all 28 EU national governments). The second is to threaten to hold an election before October 31st, which he would fight under the banner of “the people versus Parliament”. In his statement on September 2nd Mr Johnson declared that he does not want an election, but the threat remains. Mr Johnson’s advisers reckon he would win such an election easily. Many pundits are less certain, noting that Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party is still a threat and that, although the Tories may gain seats in the midlands and the north of England, they could lose them in Scotland, the south-west and London.\n",
      "\n",
      "The EU is watching these manoeuvres with alarm. It has no desire to see a disruptive no-deal Brexit, which would damage other EU countries as well as Britain. Yet it is not about to concede Mr Johnson’s main demand by dumping the Irish backstop, an insurance policy to avert a hard border with Ireland by keeping Britain in a customs union. EU governments are sceptical about any alternative arrangements to the backstop, and they note that Mr Johnson has not even put forward a concrete proposal. As for a possible election, many hope it might return a new parliament that reconsiders Brexit altogether by holding another referendum.\n"

      "F at St Thomas Aquinas, a state secondary in Glasgow’s suburbs, the post-summer return to school was leavened with the promise of a gift: an iPad for every child. The tablets cannot download apps, are tracked by the school and come with a firewall to block off-limits parts of the internet, but the pupils can take the devices home. Not all year groups have so far received them, leaving the rest jealous, says Barry Quinn, the deputy head. “They can’t wait for theirs to be deployed.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The giveaway is part of a £300m ($370m) contract signed by Glasgow City Council with , a Canadian firm, under which iPads will be handed out to nearly 50,000 pupils aged nine to 17 by 2021. More will be sent to nurseries. The deal also covers other services, including Wi-Fi links and data analysis in hospitals, leaving the council unable to say exactly how much has been spent on the iPads. But they are not the only ones to splash cash on gadgets. The city joins Edinburgh, which has 27,000 iPads in its schools, and the Borders, which plans to give them to all children in the same age range as Glasgow.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Glasgow council, tablets will improve digital literacy, preparing pupils for workplaces where tech is ubiquitous. They can be used to share information, set homework and replace textbooks. Teachers have had a year to get up to speed with how to use the things. The project “will result in raising attainment and achievement in every one of our schools and nurseries,” promises Chris Cunningham, Glasgow’s head of education.\n",
      "\n",
      "If so, that would make it different from similar past experiments. Philip Oreopoulos of the University of Toronto, co-author of a forthcoming review of randomised control trials on education technology, notes that results show academic consensus: although handing out laptops increases computer use, it has no impact or even (in one study) a negative one on attainment. There is not as much rigorous research on tablets, but little reason to think results would differ. The worry is that they end up distracting pupils more than they help them study.\n",
      "\n",
      "Some programmes that use computers for personalised tuition have, though, produced promising results. With the right software and careful management of how they are used, tablets could help, says Mr Oreopoulos. Yet so far their use in Scotland seems to be less well defined. At St Thomas Aquinas, they have been used for catch-up quizzes at the start of maths lessons and to film gymnastics to check on technique. Teachers have been told to use them in every lesson, but left to decide how.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another argument for the handout is that it levels the playing field for children who do not have access to the latest technology at home, and does so in a way that does not stigmatise those who most need the help. Critics respond that buying expensive gadgets for all is a poor way to help these pupils, especially when there are cheaper programmes that have shown better results. Giving out iPads may allow politicians to say they are dragging schools into the 21st century, but that does not mean they are a sensible investment. ■\n",
      "O evening in April, Bury Football Club celebrated. A 1-1 draw against Tranmere Rovers was enough to win promotion from the fourth to the third tier of English football. Four months later, the 134-year-old club is no more. Dire financial circumstances led to it being kicked out of the English Football League ( ) on August 27th, after a rescue bid collapsed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Life is not easy in the lower leagues of English football. The future of Bolton Wanderers, whose stadium is just a 30-minute drive from Bury’s ground and who play in the same league, was also in doubt until a last-minute deal was reached on August 28th. If the club had not found a buyer within a fortnight, it too would have been expelled. Bolton competed at European level as recently as 2008. In its latest matches, the team has been forced to field teenagers against the often brutish journeymen who dominate this tier.\n",
      "\n",
      "Bury and Bolton have both suffered mismanagement. Bury’s tangled web of finances—which included a complicated mortgage on the club’s ground and a scheme by a former chairman that involved selling the club’s car-parking spaces for £10,000 ($12,200) each—caused a potential buyer to balk at the last moment. Last week Steve Dale, the businessman who acquired the club for £1 in December, admitted that he “didn’t even know there was a football team called Bury” before he bought it. Bolton had been looking for a buyer since falling into administration in May. The deal almost collapsed this weekend with the club’s administrator blaming Ken Anderson, its previous owner, for scuppering it at the last moment (Mr Anderson denies this). “Over the years some quite strange people have taken over and run football clubs,” summed up Greg Dyke, a former chairman of the Football Association, delicately.\n",
      "\n",
      "Strange people are common in football. This is mainly because, as a rule, buying a club is a bad idea if you plan on making money. In the Championship, the second tier of English football, wages swallow 106% of turnover, according to Deloitte, a consultancy. It is little better in League One (confusingly, the third tier), where wages make up 94% of turnover. In 2017, the last year accounts are publicly available, Bury reported a loss of £2.8m from revenues of £4.7m. (By contrast Manchester United, whose ground is a 55-minute hop on a tram from Bury, had a turnover of £590m last year and operating profit of £44m.)\n",
      "\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, dire financial straits are common at the bottom of the football pyramid, where there are smaller crowds and less money is to be made from sponsorship and broadcasting rights. Bury was one of ten sides to become insolvent in 2002, when a deal for lower-league clubs fell apart. Since then, English football clubs have entered insolvency proceedings another 27 times. Yet outright collapse is rare. Before Bury, the last club to be kicked out of the league was Maidstone United in 1992.\n",
      "\n",
      "Comebacks are possible. A resurrected Maidstone is clawing its way back up the footballing ladder. Groups of Bury fans have already discussed setting up a “phoenix” club. Bury has a famous history. Until last season it held the record for the biggest Cup final victory, with its 6-0 thrashing of Derby County in 1903. If the fans have their way, it may still have a future.■\n",
      "T loathed rules. In his top-floor office in Mayfair, a ritzy district of London, the man who did more than anyone to make Britain’s public-relations industry famous (and infamous) flouted the smoking ban. Even in winter, the smoke from his daily two packs of Dunhills wafted out of the open windows. In the street below, his chauffeur waited to drive him 200 yards down the road for lunch. “I enjoy being stared at,” he said, of his choice of a red Ferrari. The was always on, blaring Prime Minister’s Questions or a cricket match. On a table were pictures of his family and his friend, client and idol, Margaret Thatcher, whose uncomplicated devotion to freedom matched his own.\n",
      "\n",
      "In death as in life, the role of Lord Bell (as he later became) in Thatcher’s three election victories has been overstated. His job—first at Saatchi & Saatchi, an advertising agency, and later at his own company—was to schmooze clients, not to come up with slogans, like the “Labour isn’t working” pun that mocked the party’s record on unemployment. But Thatcher believed in his magic, smuggling him into Downing Street during the 1987 election after the Saatchis had banned him from working on the campaign, after a falling-out. He was her “man on the Clapham omnibus”, who could channel the views of ordinary folk.\n",
      "\n",
      "He became a courtier, dispensing flattery in gravelly tones at family gatherings and Christmas Day lunch. “Boxing Day is just for the cabinet and people who give money to the party,” he boasted. When Thatcher recorded television adverts, he would sit underneath the camera to get her to relax and speak as if addressing an individual not a crowd. Despite her puritanism, she indulged his hard living. She was amused when, waking from a champagne-induced stupor to take her call, he suddenly realised he had been burgled. It was Lord Bell who announced her death, in 2013.\n",
      "\n",
      "His more significant legacy is his part in establishing London as a hub for what he termed geopolitical work and others call reputation laundering. At the height of his fame, he switched from advertising to public relations. “His proximity to the did his business no harm,” says Bernard Ingham, Thatcher’s press secretary. He won one of his first clients, F. W. de Klerk, then president of South Africa, by cold-calling his private office, supposedly on behalf of Thatcher—which he later insisted “was at least 10% true”.\n",
      "\n",
      "Colleagues called him a foul-weather friend, since he had a penchant for the dodgier end of the market. Insisting that “morality is a job for priests, not men,” he helped Augusto Pinochet, a Chilean dictator, escape extradition to Spain on charges of torture, and massaged the reputations of Alexander Lukashenko, a Belarusian strongman, and Asma al-Assad, the Syrian president’s wife. In one year he helped devise both pro- and anti-smoking campaigns. Bell Pottinger, the agency he founded in 1998, created fake social-media accounts and blogs. He was casual with facts, “because people are casual”. “The devil’s in the detail—and we didn’t want the fucking devil,” he once explained.\n",
      "\n",
      "How many of his campaigns worked is open to question. He advised Pinochet’s finance minister and Jacques Chirac (“you talk too much economic rubbish”) on elections they lost and masterminded the communications strategy for Iraq’s “transition to democracy” in 2004. He had a talent for blaming bloopers on others: he insisted David Mellor, an adulterous , decided on an embarrassing photo-op with his family; the unpopular idea to serve Spam fritters to mark the 50th anniversary of -Day was “suggested by the Royal Marines, not us”. Results mattered less than his charm, which won him contracts from London Underground though he never travelled by Tube, from the National Union of Teachers whose politics he deplored, and from the , months after he called for it to be sold.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, like his idol, he went on too long. He resisted attempts to tart up Bell Pottinger’s image, failing to grasp the premium that social media places on authenticity and the new spotlight on “fake news”. The firm collapsed in 2017, after a secret campaign to manipulate public opinion in South Africa against “white monopoly capital” was exposed. By then, Lord Bell had quit, blaming the company’s woes on other executives. But he did not retire, and set up another agency, Sans Frontières Associates. Nor did he give up on fun. A friend who visited him a few days before he died found him glued to his beloved cricket. He asked her to light him a cigarette. ■\n"

With such lofty ambitions, the name was obvious: Queen Bean Coffee. She filled in the necessary paperwork and sent it to Companies House.

She was keen, she says, to pick something that “will work for my business but not displease her majesty’s government”.\n",

      "Ms Adamson fell foul of a complex web of rules on the naming of businesses in Britain. A company name must be unique. It must not be offensive.

      "T is rising in the battle between Boris Johnson, who is determined to lead Britain out of the European Union with or without a deal on October 31st, and Parliament, where a majority of s want to stop a no-deal Brexit. This week opposition parties agreed that, when the Commons returns on September 3rd, they will try to hijack its agenda to pass a law calling for another extension of the Brexit deadline. But a day later Mr Johnson trumped them by announcing a long suspension of Parliament, from September 11th to October 14th, when a Queen’s Speech will start a new session.\n",
      "\n",
      "The prime minister claimed this was a normal way for a new government to set out its plans on crime, health and so on. Yet his main goal is the cynical one of shortening the time for s to stop no-deal. At almost five weeks, it will be Parliament’s longest suspension before a Queen’s Speech since 1945. The response was apoplectic. Jeremy Corbyn, Labour’s leader, labelled the move a “smash and grab on our democracy”. The Commons Speaker, John Bercow, called it a “constitutional outrage”. Even many Tories were unhappy. Ruth Davidson, the party’s popular leader in Scotland and a long-standing critic of Mr Johnson, quit the next day.\n",
      "\n",
      "The oddity is that a week earlier Mr Johnson was speaking of progress towards a Brexit deal. He had junked his vow not even to talk to fellow Europeans until they dropped the Irish backstop, an insurance policy to avert a hard border in Ireland by keeping the entire United Kingdom in a customs union with the . Instead, after meeting Germany’s Angela Merkel and France’s Emmanuel Macron, he offered to propose an alternative to the backstop within 30 days. Upsetting hardline Brexiteers, he also said he would not seek other changes to the withdrawal agreement negotiated by Theresa May, his predecessor.\n",
      "\n",
      "leaders listened politely. Mujtaba Rahman of the Eurasia Group consultancy says that, though sceptical of Mr Johnson’s unspecified alternatives, they may be ready to make small changes to the backstop to reduce its scope or limit it, as first planned, to Northern Ireland. But they also stand behind Ireland’s Leo Varadkar, who insists on keeping the backstop. They believe the withdrawal agreement struck with Mrs May goes as far as feasible to meet British interests without damaging the ’s single market. And they are not about to surrender to Mr Johnson’s threats of no-deal, any more than they were in 2015 when Greece threatened to quit the euro.\n",
      "\n",
      "One conclusion from these events must be that the risk of no-deal is rising fast. Two months ago Mr Johnson talked of it being “a-million-to-one against”. Now he says it is “touch and go”. In political terms, no-deal has appeal to Mr Johnson, as the best chance of fending off Nigel Farage’s Brexit Party while trying to blame Brussels and Remainer “collaborators” for the mess. On the continent, resignation to no-deal is driven not just by an unwillingness to sacrifice Ireland but also by the belief that it will damage Britain far more than the .\n",

      "The impact on the British economy, which is already teetering near recession, could indeed be severe. The government’s leaked “Operation Yellowhammer” analysis talks of possible shortages of fresh food, medicine and petrol, disruption to ports and the risk of civil unrest, especially in Northern Ireland, where trade across the border could be severely hampered. Manufacturers fret about the effect on just-in-time supply chains of tariffs and non-tariff barriers. Farmers and fishers are worried about duties on sheep, beef and fish exports. Service businesses and the talk of recruitment problems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Brexiteers dismiss this as another “Project Fear”, like the prophecies of doom before the June 2016 referendum which turned out to be too gloomy. They concede that there could be bumps in the road. But they also claim that no-deal would end uncertainty for businesses, be harmoniously managed by all sides and lead quickly to a new free-trade deal with the .\n",
      "\n",
      "As Charles Grant of the Centre for European Reform, a think-tank, notes, the chaos around no-deal would in fact maximise the uncertainty for businesses. Far from being harmonious, it would be acrimonious, especially since Mr Johnson says he would not pay the full £39bn ($48bn) Brexit bill accepted by Mrs May. And an early trade deal looks far-fetched. The would insist on the Brexit bill, protection of citizens’ rights and an Irish backstop as prerequisites. Any talks would be on a different legal basis from Article 50, which governs the current negotiations, requiring a fresh negotiating mandate, the unanimous approval of governments and ratification by national and regional parliaments.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given this, most s are understandably against no-deal. But can they stop it happening? Next week they will return to work after days of feverish exchanges over what to do. They are helped by the fact that Mr Bercow seems determined to exploit all his power as Speaker to give s a say, and that Mr Johnson has a Commons majority of just one. Yet they know that no-deal is the default option in the absence of other action and that, thanks to Mr Johnson’s suspension of Parliament, time is short. Many concede that no-deal Brexiteers are better organised and more ruthless than their opponents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Maddy Thimont Jack of the Institute for Government, another think-tank, reckons s have just enough time to legislate, if they remain united. The plan is to ask Mr Bercow for an emergency debate under standing order 24 and use this to follow the precedent of the Cooper-Letwin bill that was passed in March. Back then, s took control of the Commons agenda for a day to bring in the bill, which required the prime minister to request an extension of the original Brexit deadline of March 29th. s might also need to suspend standing order 48, which says only a minister may propose acts costing public money.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ms Thimont Jack notes that the March bill became law in less than five days. But that was partly because Mrs May chose not to obstruct it. Even if a similar bill passes the Commons in a single day, as then, it is hard to break a filibuster in the Lords, where the timetable for debate is less easily curtailed. Another problem is that any law can require Mr Johnson only to ask for an extension. He might do so on terms that allow him to refuse any offer from the , though Brussels is keen to avoid any blame for a no-deal Brexit.\n",

      "These uncertainties make some s keen to consider a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson’s government. But that, too, is fraught with difficulties (see article). So are such options as trying to revoke the Article 50 Brexit application, for which there is much less support in Parliament. The harsh truth is that, although majorities of both s and voters are against a no-deal Brexit, an idea not even floated by Brexiteers during the referendum campaign, the timetable makes it tricky to stop, however much Parliament tries.■\n"

Yet after Boris Johnson’s decision to suspend Parliament for almost five weeks, some s want to have in reserve a vote of no confidence. Such a vote could lead to a government of national unity (gnu) backed by a cross-party majority of s. This “letter-writing government”, under a caretaker prime minister, might invite the to extend the Brexit deadline of October 31st to allow time for a general election or another referendum.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the obstacles to a gnu are large. Proposing a vote of no confidence is not the same as winning one. Even winning one is complicated by the 2011 Fixed-term Parliaments Act, which allows 14 days for another government to secure confidence before an election must be called. Mr Johnson would remain prime minister during this period, and might fix the date for an election after October 31st, allowing no-deal by default.\n",

Yet as he learnt this week, he will not easily win the support of other opposition parties, let alone Tory rebels. Jo Swinson, the Liberal Democrat leader, argues that any gnu should be led by a neutral grandee, such as the Conservatives’ Ken Clarke or Labour’s Harriet Harman. But Labour will not back this idea if Mr Corbyn is not on board.\n",
      "\n",
      "Andrew Blick of King’s College, London, says history shows that Mr Corbyn is wrong to claim that only the leader of the opposition can become prime minister. In 1916 David Lloyd George ousted Herbert Asquith to form a national government that lasted until 1922, only to see Labour later displace his party. In 1931 the Tories joined a national government under the Labour prime minister, Ramsay MacDonald, but he was then disowned by his own party. In 1940 the Labour opposition told Neville Chamberlain, the Tory prime minister, that it would join a national government only if it was led by Winston Churchill, who won the war but lost the 1945 election.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gnus are common beasts in other European countries. But as Benjamin Disraeli said, “England does not love coalitions”, an aphorism confirmed by the recent one under David Cameron. And there is a big flaw in all talk of governments of national unity. What Brexit reveals is a total lack of national unity. ■\n",

In this guise the actor and former governor of California has been urging them—on behalf of the Financial Conduct Authority ( ), a regulator—to claim compensation for mis-sold payment protection insurance ( ) before the deadline of August 29th.\n",

      "Banks, which sold the bulk of policies, will be even gladder to see the back of Arnie’s bonce. They hope this week’s cut-off, agreed on in 2017 with the , will draw a line under a scandal that proved costly first for consumers and then for the banks themselves. Between 1990 and 2010 lenders reaped £44bn ($54bn) in premiums—and between 2011 and this June repaid £36bn to customers (see chart).\n",
      "\n",
      "According to Dominic Lindley of New City Agenda, a think-tank, the total cost to the banks, including administrative expenses and fines, has been £48.5bn. At one point Lloyds Banking Group employed 7,000 people to handle complaints. A late surge of deadline-beating claims will swell the industry’s bill. Lloyds made an extra £550m provision in the second quarter of this year, taking its total over £20bn.\n",
      "\n",
      "At some banks, nearly 90% of claims have been upheld. Average payouts have probably exceeded £2,000. Britons have thus enjoyed unexpected windfalls big enough to splash out on holidays or cars. In the peak year, 2012, banks paid out £6.3bn, equivalent to nearly 0.4% of —a handy boost to consumers when the economy was labouring under post-crisis austerity.\n",

      "The estimates that 45m policies were sold between 1990 and 2010. Almost half were attached to unsecured loans, for everything from cars to catalogue shopping. One-third were linked to credit- and store-card debt, and one-sixth to mortgages. In theory, loans would be repaid if borrowers lost their jobs or fell ill.\n",
      "\n",
      "Not all policies were mis-sold, but plenty were. Borrowers were told that they could have credit only with . Some probably did not know they were paying for it, because premiums were quietly bundled in with interest payments. Some who made insurance claims were rejected, for example because they were self-employed or because their medical history ruled them out. Commissions bulked up premiums. At one bank, notes Mr Lindley, an adviser’s bonus for selling a loan with was six times as much as for one without it. A ruling by the Supreme Court in 2014, that large undisclosed commissions on policies breached consumer-protection law, exposed the banks to further claims.\n",
      "\n",
      "Claims-management firms, which seek out policyholders and take a cut of any proceeds, have done nicely out of the scandal, even though the and the Financial Ombudsman Service ( ), another watchdog, have advised claimants to contact lenders directly. Britons have been irritated by calls and texts from claims companies even more than by Mr Schwarzenegger’s fizzog.\n",
      "\n",
      "Banks are hoping that claims will now dry up. But rejected claimants can appeal to the for another six months and claims firms still hope to pursue some through the courts. In any case, the financial-services industry—which came up with endowment mortgages and fiendish interest-rate hedges as well as —will surely supply another outrage eventually, if on a less spectacular scale. ■\n",
      "T boot is on the other foot. For years the most prominent Tory troublemakers were Eurosceptics, who were willing to do anything to get Britain out of the European Union. Now the Eurosceptics have captured the government and the most prominent rebels are Euro-moderates, who are willing to do anything to prevent Britain from leaving the without a deal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The insurgents are about 40 strong, though not all will vote in the same way at the same time. They are a looser alliance than the old rebels who, in the form of the European Research Group, had their own whips and party line. But Boris Johnson’s increasingly hardline policies have stiffened their spines. The alliance contains a collection of Tory grandees, including five former cabinet ministers, and a smaller group of escapees, such as Sir Oliver Letwin and Guto Bebb, who have decided to stand down at the next election. Ruth Davidson’s resignation as leader of the Scottish Conservatives has weakened Toryism north of the border and provided the rebels with another example of the cost of Mr Johnson’s policies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The alliance contains some of the oddest rebels ever assembled in politics. Philip Hammond, the closest thing the alliance has got to a leader, joined the Conservative Party when he was still at school and spent the past nine years as transport secretary, foreign secretary and chancellor of the exchequer, before quitting in the last days of Theresa May’s government. His understated manner and fondness for economic orthodoxy earned him the nickname “spreadsheet Phil” (though he is much more entertaining in private than his public persona suggests). When he voted against the government on the Northern Ireland bill last month it was the first time he had broken with his party in 22 years, which is not something that could be said of many Brexiteers.\n",
      "\n",
      "In his essay of 1919 on “Politics as a Vocation”, Max Weber made a distinction between the “ethic of responsibility” and the “ethic of conviction”. The ethic of responsibility is all about pragmatism—doing what you can to keep the show on the road—whereas the ethic of conviction is all about moral purity. Mr Hammond is the embodiment of the first, just as Dominic Cummings, Mr Johnson’s chief of staff and, according to his critics, unelected deputy prime minister, is the embodiment of the second.\n",
      "\n",
      "David Gauke is a solicitor by profession who ended up as Lord Chancellor. Dominic Grieve is another lawyer—a no less—who served as attorney-general. Greg Clark is a former management consultant who was a quietly effective secretary of state for business. The only member of the alliance who has the whiff of the rebel about him is Rory Stewart, who spent years wandering around dangerous bits of the world as a latter-day Lawrence of Arabia. But Mr Stewart is also a worshipper of British institutions, whose includes working as a tutor to Princes William and Harry and serving in the army and the Foreign Office.\n",
      "\n",
      "These odd rebels bring a formidable range of skills to their mission. As a former foreign secretary and chancellor, Mr Hammond has a network of contacts both in Britain and the wider . He also knows as much as anybody about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on business. Mr Gauke is one of the most popular s in Parliament—“clever”, “subtle” and “humorous” are a few of the adjectives that fellow members shower on him. Sir Oliver and Mr Grieve are both veterans of the “May wars” to prevent the government from steamrolling Parliament and have created a store of templates and strategies. Mr Grieve also has close relations with Sir Keir Starmer, Labour’s Brexit spokesman. Mr Stewart single-handedly lit up the recent Tory leadership campaign with his improvised walkabouts (which he has recently resumed) and excited a new generation of young people about Conservatism. “Rory is a bit of a messiah,” says an who has known him for years, “but at least messiahs have a way of making converts.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The rebels should be under no illusion about how difficult their job is. This is not a normal government. It is dominated by brutal ideologues who will use any smear (“traitor”, “collaborator”, “fifth-columnist”) to defeat their opponents. On August 28th Mr Johnson made the extraordinary move of asking the queen to suspend Parliament from September 11th to October 14th, in an attempt to reduce the number of days that s have to prevent a no-deal exit on October 31st—a move that Mr Hammond described as a “constitutional outrage” and “profoundly undemocratic”.\n",
      "\n",
      "But the rebels have two important things on their side. The most obvious is numbers. Suspending Parliament is a sign of Mr Johnson’s weakness, not his strength. The prime minister has a working majority of only one. The bulk of s are opposed to a no-deal Brexit. And Parliament has a good record of winning its battles with the executive. Mrs May lost three times, despite throwing all the government’s time and resources for two years behind getting her deal through. The second thing on the rebels’ side is fear. Several senior members of Mr Johnson’s government are privately terrified that his “do or die” tactics may sink the economy and destroy the Conservative Party for a generation. As Brexit day approaches and the pound sinks, bankruptcies rise, shortages loom and civil disorder resumes in Northern Ireland, the people who crack may not be the Europeans but some unexpected Johnson loyalists.\n",
      "\n",
      "In search of a cause\n",
      "\n",
      "The rebels’ deeper problem is what happens to them after October 31st. The Eurosceptics reshaped British politics because they had a single aim and unflinching determination. The Euro-moderates are united on little other than preventing no-deal. Some want a second referendum to overturn Brexit, some want a version of Mrs May’s deal, and some may even want a long-term realignment of politics which would consign the Brexiteers to a party of their own. The alliance could easily fracture as rapidly as it has formed. It is worryingly easy to lose control of a party to the men and women of conviction. It is much more difficult to win it back. ■\n"

EU leaders said Mr Johnson had no realistic alternative for averting a hard Irish border. Mrs Merkel seemed to suggest he should find a solution within 30 days.

      "I results day and the phones are ringing at the University of Exeter. The university is much bigger than it was half a decade ago, so there is lots to do. Some 120 staff and students advise applicants making a late bid, as well as ones who have missed the grades they need to get in. Scribbled posters count the remaining spots, and remind those on the phones to check for an English-language qualification. Most important, one concludes, is to “have fun…we are making (some) dreams come true! :)”\n",
      "\n",
      "At Exeter, the mood is calm. But at other universities, it will be closer to panic. Each institution’s future depends on securing enough students. This reflects a change in government policy. Admissions used to be managed, with limits set on the number of students each university could take. But beginning in 2012 restrictions began to be lifted, before disappearing entirely in 2015, since when universities have been free to take as many as they want. The result, says Sir Steve Smith, vice-chancellor at Exeter, is “the market, red in tooth and claw”.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is lots of variation, but in general elite institutions have been the biggest growers. Some, including Oxford and Cambridge, have chosen not to expand. But most prestigious universities have sucked up students, grateful for their fees, which subsidise research. The intake of British students at members of the Russell Group of older, research-focused universities has grown by 16% since restrictions were lifted. Some have ballooned. Bristol’s intake has shot up by 62%, Exeter’s by 61% and Newcastle’s by 43%.\n",
      "\n",
      "Universities lower down the pecking order have fared less well. The intake of British students at institutions in the post-1992 group of universities, former polytechnics which offered vocational qualifications, is flat. London Metropolitan’s intake is down by 42%, Kingston’s by 33% and Southampton Solent’s by 28%. Some have diversified by offering more qualifications sponsored by companies, postgraduate degrees or apprenticeships. Others are getting into financial difficulty.\n",
      "\n",
      "Universities are keenly aware that they are mostly competing with a handful of rivals for students, and that geography plays a big role in determining who those rivals are. Exeter, in south-west England, has commissioned research which shows it attracts students who live near the 5 motorway that runs into town, and struggles to recruit from anywhere north of Birmingham, in the Midlands. The university therefore keeps a close eye on Bath and Bristol, nearby institutions held in similar regard. Mark Corver of data , a consultancy, notes that many larger London universities, which take students with weaker grades, have struggled as the capital’s secondary schools have got better, providing youngsters with the qualifications to aim higher. So too have universities in remote parts of the country, including Cumbria and Aberystwyth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Students seem to prefer close-knit, campus universities. Exeter is one example. Others include Aston, which takes 66% more British students than it did before the cap was lifted; East Anglia, which takes 34% more; and Bath, which takes 24% more. It tends to be easier to build on a campus than in a city centre, says Mike Nicholson, head of admissions at Bath. And for a generation of students who party less, study more and are often influenced by cautious parents, campus universities are a nice half-way point between school and adulthood.\n",
      "\n",
      "Universities not attracting enough students have to adapt. Since the new system was introduced, almost all have charged the maximum allowed—now £9,250 ($11,250) a year. Since students are entitled to government loans, which they don’t have to repay until they earn more than £25,725 a year, they are relatively unfussed by upfront costs. But price competition has begun to emerge in the form of hefty scholarships. A more common way to appeal to students is to lower the grades for entry. At its most devious, this takes the form of offers which do not require the applicant to achieve any grades at all, provided they make the university their first choice. Recruiting students will at least get easier as the number of 18-year-olds rises in 2021.\n",
      "\n",
      "Improving a university’s appeal through more reputable means is hard, but not impossible. Coventry has shot up the rankings, and has a 50% bigger intake than a decade ago. In 2010 a “shocking” low score in its student-satisfaction survey prompted a rethink, says Ian Dunn, the university’s provost. Now feedback is requested midway through a course and students are informed of changes made as a result within five days. The university has set up a college which offers degrees from £6,350. It has also cut back joint courses, like accounting and finance, which students enjoyed less. Before the rules changed, Exeter had gone further still, getting rid of weak departments, including chemistry. But nationwide, student satisfaction is yet to rise, indicating these universities are in a minority (the measure is, though, a lagging indicator, as students fill in forms only after finishing their degree).\n",
      "\n",
      "Growth is no guarantee of financial stability, as can be seen at Cardiff and Surrey, which have taken in lots more students but not enough to match their spending. That is little consolation for the small number of universities, struggling to attract applicants, which are said to be near bankruptcy. Changes in policy have caused a great deal of flux in higher education. But the growing number of students at elite universities would probably regard the flux as a price worth paying. ■\n",
      "A with oil headed east from the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean, bound for Greece, just before midnight on August 18th. Nothing unusual in that—120,000 vessels navigate the strait each year, carrying a third of the world’s oil and gas. But the Iranian-flagged Adrian Darya 1 was no ordinary tanker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Days earlier she had been renamed and reflagged, with fresh paint covering her old identity, Grace 1. That accompanied her release from over a month of detention in Gibraltar, a British overseas territory. The episode not only marked the latest chapter in a bitter struggle between Iran and America. It also highlights Britain’s strained effort to balance its Iran policy between American belligerence and European emollience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The backdrop is President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from a multinational nuclear agreement that his predecessor, Barack Obama, reached with Iran in 2015. This deal had limited Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for relaxing sanctions. But American sanctions were tightened sharply in April under Mr Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure”. Iran has hit back, apparently attacking ships in the Gulf of Oman in May and shooting down an American spy drone on June 20th. The latter caused Mr Trump to order—and then cancel—air strikes on Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the febrile atmosphere on July 4th, when British marines abseiled onto the deck of the Grace 1 in Gibraltarian waters. They did so on the basis of American intelligence suggesting the tanker’s oil was bound for Syria, whose main refinery is under sanctions. On July 19th Iran procured a bargaining chip by grabbing a British tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Strait of Hormuz. That may have strengthened Iran’s hand. But it was not until it promised that the Grace 1 would not be sent to Syria, or any other forbidden destination, that Gibraltar agreed to release the vessel.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a relief to Britain. The threat of further ship-grabs would diminish, and Iran would probably release Britain’s tanker in turn. But with the Adrian Darya 1’s paint barely dry, a court in Washington, , issued a warrant for its re-seizure, on the basis that the ship was secretly controlled by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, which America considers a terrorist organisation. That cut no ice with Gibraltar. It pointed out that the ’s sanctions laws differ from America’s, and that Europe—like the rest of the world—does not deem the Revolutionary Guards terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The diplomatic tussle has put Britain in a tight spot. Like its European allies, it wants Iran to stick to the nuclear agreement. In January Britain spearheaded, with France and Germany, the creation of Instex, a barter mechanism to enable certain Europe-Iran transactions, particularly for humanitarian supplies. British diplomats are eager to soothe Iran with trade. The seizure of the Grace 1 threw a spanner in the works, not least because Britain was prodded into action by American intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boris Johnson, who succeeded Theresa May as prime minister midway through the tanker crisis, has adopted a confrontational position towards the regarding Brexit. He has also courted Mr Trump, who is holding out the prospect of a post-Brexit trade deal to help cushion the British economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That leaves Britain’s Iran policy in a parlous position. Should Mr Johnson keep siding with the Europeans, he may anger America, risking the promise of a trade deal. But if he backs Mr Trump and heaps pressure on Iran, he could cause the collapse of the nuclear deal and a spat with Europe. “You can’t maintain that post-Brexit you’ll be a loyal ally of European nations in matters of security and ditch 20 years of Iran policy by moving over to the American side,” says Sir Richard Dalton, Britain’s ambassador to Iran in 2003-06.\n",
      "\n",
      "So far Mr Johnson has sought a balance. Whereas Mrs May tried to organise a European security mission for the Gulf, Mr Johnson signed up to an American-led scheme. John Bolton, Mr Trump’s national security adviser, noted with pleasure that the choice “reflects a change from the prior government”. But the Adrian Darya 1’s release shows that even Mr Johnson is unwilling to break with Europe and join Mr Trump in throttling Iran. At least not yet. ■\n"

      "I British is to cherish understatement, DragWorld is the most treasonous gathering since the Gunpowder Plot. Tread the pink carpet at London’s Olympia convention hall and your eyes are drawn to either a 10ft-tall silver stiletto or a well-chiselled man in nothing but multicoloured pants and striped socks. Donna Trump, Poppycock and Rococo Chanel work the crowd. Punters hunt for gold among stalls hawking fake eyelashes, fishnet tights and wigs in outrageous shades of yellow, purple and pink.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is, of course, nothing new about men in tights. In his book “Queer City: Gay London from the Romans to the present day”, Peter Ackroyd likens 18th-century “mollies” to present-day drag queens. For much of the 20th century, drag acts were a mainstay of gay bars and clubs. But the crowds flocking to DragWorld demonstrate how an underground pastime has broken into the cultural mainstream. This year more than 10,000 people showed up to the two-day event, now in its third year. The will broadcast a British version of “RuPaul’s Drag Race”, an American talent contest, in October. And a judge from the American show will compete in the latest series of “Strictly Come Dancing”, one of the corporation’s biggest hits.\n",
      "\n",
      "Many of the new fans are straight women. Nathan Stone of the Group, which organises the event as well as tours for drag acts, reckons a little under two-thirds of audiences are women aged 16-21. “It is not just for old gay queens anymore,” says a stallholder, who says he flogs as many of his glittery dresses to women as men. “We’ve just had someone buy one as a wedding dress.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Perhaps surprisingly, women seem keen to take make-up tips from the queens. One such fan, queuing for a £17 ($21) meet-and-greet session, confesses to copying some of their looks, albeit in a toned-down way. The beauty industry was quick to spot the market’s potential. Pretty Polly, a tights brand, and Lush, a cosmetics firm, have stands at the show. “If you look at the queens, we could learn something from them,” says Joanne Etherson of Sally Beauty, which sells hair products and sponsors the show. “The hair colour, the flamboyance. It’s the extreme of everything we celebrate.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Others are attracted by the broad array of body sizes and fashion styles on show. The convention presents a less restrictive idea of what it means to be a woman than do glossy fashion magazines, argues Mr Stone. A barrister’s clerk, who has donned silver sequined trousers and a bright pink top for the day, says she appreciates the freedom to wear whatever she likes without judgment.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gay men largely welcome drag’s newfound popularity. One, who is collecting queens’ autographs in a notepad that booms “ u ok hun?”, reckons it shows society has moved from tolerating gay culture to embracing it. Brad Williams, who sells fake eyelashes with his business and romantic partner, agrees. “Before it was: ‘Here’s a cookie cutter. Fit in’,” he says. “Now to fit in you almost have to be different.”■\n",
      "“I an uphill struggle,” admits Shaun Bailey, the Conservative candidate for mayor of London. A poll in May put Mr Bailey 20 points behind the Labour incumbent, Sadiq Khan, who is up for re-election next May. Mr Bailey, a 48-year-old member of the London Assembly who could pass for two decades younger, has the task of turning the contest around. If the polls are right, by the end of the campaign he may start to look his age.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although Mr Khan enjoys an imposing lead, he is beatable. Londoners like his punchy opposition to Brexit and Donald Trump. But when it comes to policy the mayor’s record is threadbare. Mr Khan has won lots of funding for house-building, but this will take years to have an effect. Big transport projects such as Crossrail have fallen behind on his watch. Crime is unignorable, following a rise in stabbings. In July Mr Khan’s approval rating fell to -3, its lowest-ever level. A Tory candidate could have had a puncher’s chance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet big hitters from the party sat the race out. Former cabinet ministers such as Justine Greening declined to stand. Instead, a few local politicians battled it out. Mr Bailey, a born-and-bred Londoner whose electoral experience extends largely to two general-election defeats, won. The mayoralty was once a jewel in the Tory crown, when Boris Johnson served two terms in 2008-16. Today it is an afterthought.\n",
      "\n",
      "Unlike cities such as Liverpool and Manchester, which have long been Tory-free zones, London has historically been fairly balanced (see chart). Election results in the capital used to tally with the rest of the country, says Tony Travers of the London School of Economics. That changed under Tony Blair’s government as Labour started to cement control, snatching inner-London seats from the Conservatives and colouring the capital red from the inside out. In 1987 the Tories had 58 s in London. In 2017 they won just 21.\n",
      "\n",
      "An attitude that London is lost permeates the Conservatives. The dominant idea is that the party’s future lurks in places such as Bishop Auckland, a market town in County Durham, rather than Battersea, a London suburb stuffed with well-off young parents. London does not loom large in Mr Johnson’s strategy of trying to scoop up votes from disaffected Labour voters in towns that supported Brexit.\n",
      "\n",
      "This creates a strong headwind for Mr Bailey. Building an independent London-Conservative brand that appeals to the capital’s liberal population will not be easy—particularly given some of his past comments, including that multiculturalism could turn Britain into a “crime-riddled cesspool”. Scottish Tories have managed to distinguish themselves from the Westminster lot under their star leader, Ruth Davidson. Mr Bailey’s lower profile makes that harder. The Greens and Liberal Democrats, the latter of whom came top in the recent European elections in London, are better placed to woo liberals fed up with Mr Khan.\n",
      "\n",
      "There is another way of looking at London. Four in ten people there voted Leave, like Mr Bailey. The city backed a Tory mayor as recently as 2012. And there are plenty of voters in the capital for whom Mr Khan’s “London is open” message grates. Whether they are enough for an election-winning coalition is another matter. ■\n",
      "I up from your two-piece and chips, you can set your watch to the rhythm of the fried-chicken shop. Noon brings school kids wolfing down a few wings. At 3pm come the pram-pushers, searching for an affordable dinner. Then it’s the end-of-school crush, commuters home from work and finally the drunk, craving stodge to soak up the booze.\n",
      "\n",
      "None are so devoted as the young. In his teenage years, Yinka Ibrahim would spend “unreasonable amounts of time” in his local branch of Morley’s, a south London chain, chewing the fat with his mates. Three or four times a week he would go straight after school, always ordering four wings and chips, for no more than £2 ($2.40). If you ran out of money, you could always try petitioning the owner. Bossman would look after you.\n",
      "\n",
      "Such loyalty explains the Home Office’s decision to target chicken shops in its latest campaign to curb knife crime, which has risen sharply since 2014. On August 14th it announced a plan to distribute 321,000 take-away boxes to chicken shops, emblazoned with anti-knife-crime messages and case studies of young people who have handed in their blades.\n",
      "\n",
      "The launch went down about as well as a dodgy drumstick. David Lammy, a Labour , accused the government of perpetuating a racist stereotype that black people—who are disproportionately likely to be victims of knife crime—love fried chicken. Mr Ibrahim had the same reaction when his friends shared the story. Some sent chicken boxes to the Home Office, with scrawled suggestions of how else to tackle crime. Elijah Quashie, a YouTuber known as the Chicken Connoisseur for his reviews of shops, was unimpressed.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet focusing on chicken shops is not completely bird-brained. The Home Office insists that its marketing campaign—which launched last year and has also run at music festivals and in community centres—is aimed at ten- to 21-year-olds of any ethnicity. If so, it is not hard to see why such joints were picked. Shift, a charity, found fried chicken was the most popular fast food for young people in Newham, a London borough. All City Media Solutions, which worked with the Home Office on the campaign, built its business on teenagers’ love of wings, selling advertising on screens in the shops. It says two-thirds of chicken-shop customers are aged 16-24.\n",
      "\n",
      "The shops score highly on two other elements of a marketer’s wish-list: “dwell time” and positive association, since customers feel loyal to their branch. More than a third of customers Shift monitored spent over five minutes in a shop after receiving their food, and one in eight stuck around for more than 20. Mr Ibrahim, now 21, still goes about once a week to the shop he frequented as a child. He feels guilty if he orders chicken elsewhere, because he thinks of it as the “hub of the community”. And a lifetime’s experience tells him he can trust the food: “I know they don’t sell pigeon.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Chicken shops are also in the right places. They are concentrated in deprived areas, which are also home to gangs, says Simon Harding of the University of West London. When the Home Office trialled the idea in March, it picked 15 branches in knife-crime hotspots. Shan Selvendran, boss of Morley’s, was keen on the campaign because a 15-year-old boy was stabbed to death outside one of his branches last year. And gangs sometimes groom new recruits by buying them fried chicken and then making them repay the debt, for example by running drugs. “There is a logic there,” says Mr Harding. “It’s just the execution has been pretty clunky.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Even so, the campaign seems unlikely to work. Research suggests people who carry knives do so to protect themselves in areas they perceive to be unsafe, points out James Densley, an expert on British gangs. Inspirational stories alone are unlikely to alter that perception. The boxes will be split between 210 shops, or about 1,500 per branch. Since a branch can go through 1,000 in a day, it is all rather small fry. ■\n"

      "T is not a big one, nor a beautiful one, nor does it keep anything in, nor out. But it is a sacred one. Situated in a lay-by on the 487, just north of Llanrhystud, about half-way up the west coast of Wales, its importance derives from two words graffitied on it by Meic Stephens, a journalist and activist, in the 1960s: Cofiwch Dryweryn. Remember Tryweryn.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 1965 Liverpool City Council flooded the Tryweryn valley to provide water for the English city. Welsh authorities were not consulted. “The fact that the hamlet of Capel Celyn stood in the middle of the site did not deter them: nor did the fact that it was one of the very Welshest parts of all Wales,” writes Jan Morris in her book about what she describes as “the oldest of the English colonies”. Some credit the creation of the reservoir with instilling a stronger sense of Welshness in the Welsh. Demands for bilingual signs, a television channel and a Welsh assembly all started to gain support after the flooding.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which is why, when the graffiti was painted over with the word in February, locals were outraged. Two months later someone tried to demolish the wall, taking a chunk off the top, which inflamed things further. Dyfed-Powys police labelled the incident a hate crime. Since then, Cofiwch Dryweryn graffiti has popped up across the country. 4 , a Welsh-language broadcaster, commissioned a documentary about the wall, its imitators and its meaning. The original graffiti has been repainted, and a charity set up to protect it. At the National Eisteddfod, an annual festival of Welsh culture that took place outside Llanrwst earlier this month, canny businesses sold mugs, bumper stickers and cushions emblazoned with the slogan.\n",
      "\n",
      "The result has been a swelling of Welsh pride—and some anti-English sentiment—as a new generation learns about the flooding of Tryweryn. Coupled with growing frustration at Westminster’s handling of Brexit, it has got a small but noisy minority talking louder about independence, something that Wales has historically been far less interested in than other members of the United Kingdom are.\n",
      "\n",
      "At the Eisteddfod, a sign at a pavilion run by the Welsh Assembly asked visitors to jot down their hopes for Wales over the next 20 years. Most responses said annibyniaeth, or independence. In May more than 1,000 people joined a pro-independence rally in Cardiff, organised by All Under One Banner, a campaign group modelled on its Scottish namesake. A second rally in July attracted 5,000-8,000. A third will take place in September. More than a dozen town councils, mostly in north Wales, have come out in favour of independence this year. The share of the Welsh public that agrees is still very small: a YouGov poll in May put it at 11%. But it has grown from just 6% in September 2017. A further 26% want more powers for the Welsh Assembly, which is a feeble thing compared with its Scottish or Northern Irish counterparts.\n",
      "\n",
      "“We used to talk about independence being a long-term goal, which has a certain elasticity to it. That’s gone, certainly in the language we use,” says Adam Price, leader of the nationalist Plaid Cymru, which holds ten seats in the 60-member Assembly. Brexit, he says, was the “booster rocket”. Unlike Scotland and Northern Ireland, Wales voted to leave the European Union (by 53% to 47%). But the vote expressed a feeling of neglect, says Mr Price: it was the “wrong answer to the right question” of how to deal with Wales’s economic stagnation. Suzy Davies, a Tory assemblywoman who backs the union, says there is a “genuine political conversation” around independence in the political bubble. “But I don’t believe it’s on the doorstep. I’m not hearing it in my social media.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Independence is most popular among Europhiles. Some 16% of Remainers in Wales support it, compared with only 6% of Leavers. Yet there are echoes of the Brexit campaign in their arguments. A handbook produced by YesCymru, a pro-independence group, reads like a Brexit manifesto, arguing that the constitutional set-up of the union is undemocratic and that a Wales unshackled would be richer and able to do its own trade deals. An independent Wales, insists Mr Price, would be open, diverse, international and inclusive. It would work closely with England, but in a partnership of equals rather than as a rule-taker. It is a way of “taking back control”, says one participant at the Eisteddfod.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sion Jobbins of YesCymru says it is important to lay the groundwork now, “so that we are ready when Scotland leaves and Northern Ireland reunites. The alternative is incorporation.” He worries that Westminster would dissolve the Welsh Assembly and absorb Wales into a unitary state. “They sent troops for rocks in the Falklands. They will never give up Wales,” he says. Such excitable talk is not uncommon among campaigners.\n",
      "\n",
      "That gets to the heart of the incipient independence movement. Like Brexit and the nationalist campaigns in Scotland and Northern Ireland, the argument is less about economics or politics than identity. And that is what makes it worth watching. Recent years have shown how quickly identity movements can take off. The Cofiwch Dryweryn wall went from neglected graffiti to national treasure in six months.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet the risk with identity movements is that it can be hard to know when to stop. At the Eisteddfod, across the way from YesCymru’s stall, a group of artists had set up a “passport office” issuing travel documents for the nation of Llanrwst, a town of about 3,300, which in 1276 was declared independent by the then (Welsh) Prince of Wales. It was a bit of fun, and elicited no more than good-natured chuckles. Until recently, so did the notion of Welsh independence. ■\n",
      "A the Downing Street Policy Unit can be one of the great engines of British government—a generator of new ideas and a recruiter of bright outsiders. Under Margaret Thatcher it championed privatisation and deregulation. Under Tony Blair it powered public-sector reform. But under Theresa May it withered into insignificance. In Mrs May’s glory days—they did exist!—Nick Timothy tried to do all the thinking and after her disastrous election the lights in the Policy Unit went out completely.\n",
      "\n",
      "They are blazing once again. The Policy Unit is now more than 20-strong, with impressive new recruits such as Liam Booth-Smith, a think-tanker, and John Bew, a professor at King’s College London and author of an excellent biography of Clement Attlee. So far the atmosphere is all energy and camaraderie. The unit’s members feel like commandos who have been given a momentous mission (taking Britain through Brexit) and have survived a hazing by a tough sergeant (Dominic Cummings). The day starts with a meeting at 8am and ends with another one at 7pm.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boris Johnson has a journalist’s interest in ideas—the bigger and brighter the better. He also has a Churchillian taste for mavericks. During the second world war Churchill surrounded himself with oddballs like Frederick Lindemann (“the Prof”), reasoning that unconventional times required unconventional solutions. Mr Johnson has concluded from the past two years of paralysis that the safest option may be the riskiest, and the riskiest the safest.\n",
      "\n",
      "The maverick-in-chief is Mr Cummings, who sits above the Policy Unit rather than in it but whose influence is omnipresent. Mr Cummings is nothing if not an ideas man and frequently sets his underlings weekend homework such as finding areas of British comparative advantage that will strike fear into the European Union. The head of the Policy Unit, Munira Mirza, is a former member of the Revolutionary Communist Party, a Trotskyite groupuscule, and enthusiastic contributor to its house organ, Living Marxism. Many of her former comrades-in-arms such as Claire Fox, a member of the European Parliament for the Brexit Party, are prominent in Conservative Eurosceptic circles.\n",
      "\n",
      "Will the Policy Unit be able to preserve its place at the heart of government? It is one thing to work yourself up into a frenzy of enthusiasm when Parliament is in recess and you’ve been in your job for a month. It is another to keep going when Parliament is in turmoil and hundreds of thousands of protesters are on the streets. Mr Johnson’s government could easily end up being one of the shortest-lived in history. Yet if it survives—and particularly if it survives with an enhanced majority after an autumn election—there is a good chance that the Policy Unit will remain at the heart of Boris-world. Mr Johnson has a close relationship with Ms Mirza, forged when she was one of his deputies as mayor of London and reinforced when she defended ill-judged comments he had made about burqas. During Mr Johnson’s first few weeks he has demonstrated the value of energy in the executive, setting a clear agenda for government, issuing a flurry of domestic-policy initiatives and centralising power in Downing Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "Which all raises an intriguing question: what policies will the Policy Unit produce if Mr Johnson gets to stay in office for the longer term? The easiest way to answer this question is to study Policy Exchange, a centre-right think-tank whose alumni, including Ms Mirza and Messrs Booth-Smith and Bew, dominate the Policy Unit and are scattered throughout government. The think-tank has a library of papers on everything from the Irish backstop to social care. At the moment it is particularly interested in using infrastructure spending to bind the United Kingdom together. It is a measure of Policy Exchange’s influence that Mr Johnson referred to its recent paper on creating a British space programme in his first speech on the steps of Downing Street.\n",
      "\n",
      "A second way is to study Mr Cummings’s voluminous blog postings. Mr Cummings is an inveterate champion of reforming Whitehall and taking on vested interests (which he calls “the blob”). But perhaps his most interesting recent musings focus on how Britain is falling behind in the race to apply science and technology to solving practical problems—for example, using big data to tackle crime and agri-tech to boost productivity on farms.\n",
      "\n",
      "A third way is to study Mr Johnson himself. This is harder than you think. Though he has basked in the public eye for decades, Mr Johnson is a consummate shape-shifter. But a couple of things strike Bagehot about the prime minister in his current incarnation. One is that he sees himself as a liberal Tory who is fulfilling the party’s historical function of adjusting to the arrival of a new force in British life—in this case nationalist populism. Mr Johnson is likely to embrace a peculiar mixture of liberal causes (such as environmentalism) and populist ones (such as stiffer prison sentences). The second is that Mr Johnson sees politics through the prism of City Hall, his former base as mayor, just as Mrs May saw it through the prism of the Home Office, which she ran before Downing Street. His main focus other than Brexit is on basic public services such as policing and transport. He has a (sometimes fatal) fascination with big infrastructure projects. Leaving aside Europe—admittedly a big aside—Mr Johnson is intellectually closer to Michael Heseltine, with his enthusiasm for fixing the problems of the left-behind with state activism, than he is to Thatcher.\n",
      "\n",
      "All this suggests that, if Mr Johnson survives the next few months, Britain will be bombarded with a strange mix of policies. A bit of liberalism here and a bit of populism there, a flurry of initiatives for left-behind Britain one moment and a flurry for high-tech Britain the next. The challenge for the Policy Unit will not be remaining at the heart of government. It will be trying to produce some coherence out of this mish-mash—and trying to turn hot air into concrete policies that have some impact on the real world. ■\n"

      "WHEN HE became prime minister, Boris Johnson insisted that he would not be a supplicant visiting continental capitals to plead over the terms of Brexit. Unless the European Union agreed in advance to ditch the Irish backstop from the current Brexit withdrawal agreement, he would not talk to his fellow leaders at all. Instead, Britain was ready to leave the EU on October 31st, with or without a deal. Yet this week he flew to Berlin and Paris to see Angela Merkel and Emmanuel Macron before going on to the G7 summit in Biarritz.\n",
      "\n",
      "Beforehand, Mr Johnson wrote to fellow European leaders to repeat that the backstop, intended to avert a hard border in Ireland in all circumstances by keeping the United Kingdom in a customs union with the EU, must go. He also insisted that, contrary to promises to adhere to many Brussels rules so as to preserve a level playing-field, Britain must have freedom to diverge from EU regulations. Despite this uncompromisingly hard line, he was politely received by the German chancellor and the French president. Mr Johnson’s supporters promptly talked up the results, claiming that Mrs Merkel had given him 30 days to produce an alternative to the backstop, while Mr Macron had conceded that the withdrawal agreement could be amended.\n",
      "\n",
      "Both suggestions are wide of the mark. In reality, Mrs Merkel was just musing that, since no realistic alternative to the backstop had been found in three years, it would be testing to find one in the next 30 days, implying that any idea that was found would go into the non-binding political declaration about the future. As for Mr Macron, who earlier called the current backstop “indispensable”, he was merely pointing out that the shortage of time before October 31st meant that any Brexit deal would have to be fundamentally the same as the current withdrawal agreement.\n",
      "\n",
      "The truth is that European leaders have every incentive to listen to and engage with Mr Johnson. They wish to avoid the no-deal Brexit that he is threatening on October 31st, as it would damage the EU, albeit less than Britain. But their bigger concern is to stand solidly behind the Irish prime minister, Leo Varadkar, who has staked his position on keeping the backstop as the only guarantee against any risk of a return to a hard border in Ireland.\n",
      "\n",
      "When Mr Johnson duly fails in late September to produce a credible alternative, EU leaders will insist that it is up to the British government whether to accept the backstop in some form or to leave with no deal. Although many European leaders would like Brexit to be over, they will also make clear that they are willing to extend the deadline beyond October 31st if needs be. They will certainly want to emphasise that, if Britain falls off a cliff, it will be by choice, not because the EU pushed it.\n",
      "\n",
      "They also have half an eye on the Westminster Parliament, which returns to work on September 3rd. They are keenly following discussions by MPs from all parties on how to thwart a no-deal Brexit, either by legislative means or by the nuclear option of a vote of no confidence in Mr Johnson’s government. The talk of giving him 30 days to come up with a solution may yet delay a vote of confidence. But the EU still believes that, if MPs really want to stop Britain leaving with no-deal, they have the numbers to do it.\n",
      "A SUPERTANKER LOADED with oil headed east from the Strait of Gibraltar into the Mediterranean, bound for Greece, just before midnight on August 18th. Nothing unusual in that—some 120,000 vessels pass through the strait each year, carrying a third of the world’s oil and gas. But the Iranian-flagged Adrian Darya 1 was no ordinary tanker.\n",
      "\n",
      "Just days earlier she had been renamed and reflagged, with fresh paint covering her old identity, Grace 1. Those actions accompanied the vessel’s release from over a month of detention in Gibraltar, an overseas territory of Britain. The episode not only marks the latest chapter in the increasingly bitter struggle between Iran and America—which made a final effort to seize the ship hours before she set sail—but also highlights Britain’s increasingly strained effort to balance its Iran policy between American belligerence and European emollience.\n",
      "\n",
      "The backdrop to the crisis is President Donald Trump’s withdrawal last year from the multinational nuclear agreement that his predecessor, Barack Obama, had reached with Iran in 2015. This agreement had limited Iran’s nuclear programme in exchange for a partial lifting of sanctions.\n",
      "\n",
      "American sanctions on Iran were tightened sharply in April under Mr Trump’s policy of “maximum pressure”. Moreover, any foreign firms that do business with Iran also face the threat of punishment. That prompted Iran to walk away from elements of the pact and to hit back in other ways. In May America and several of its allies blamed Iran for mine attacks on ships in the Gulf of Oman. Matters almost came to a head when Iran shot down an American spy drone on June 20th, causing Mr Trump to order—and then cancel—air strikes on Iran.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was the febrile atmosphere on July 4th, when British marines abseiled onto the deck of the Adrian Darya 1 in Gibraltarian waters. They did so on the basis of American intelligence suggesting that the tanker’s oil was bound for Syria, whose main refinery is under EU sanctions. On July 19th, after weeks of naval shadow-boxing, Iran procured a bargaining chip of its own by grabbing a British tanker, the Stena Impero, in the Strait of Hormuz on spurious charges of safety violations.\n",
      "\n",
      "That may have strengthened Iran’s hand. But it was not until Iran promised that the tanker would not be sent to Syria, or any other destination covered by EU sanctions—promises extracted after weeks of intense diplomacy involving British and Iranian diplomats—that Gibraltar relented. “In light of the assurances we have received,” said the territory’s chief minister on August 15th, “there are no longer any reasonable grounds for the continued legal detention of the Grace 1 in order to ensure compliance with the EU Sanctions Regulation.” The ship was accordingly freed.\n",
      "\n",
      "That was a relief to Britain. The threat of further ship-grabs, which had led the Royal Navy to send extra warships to the Gulf, would diminish, and Iran would probably release Britain’s tanker in turn. But the drama was not over yet. The Adrian Darya’s new paint barely dry, when America made a last-ditch effort to keep the heat on Iran. The next day, on August 16th, a federal court in Washington, DC, issued a warrant for its re-seizure, on the basis that the ship was secretly controlled by a network of companies run by Iran’s Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), a powerful branch of Iran’s armed forces.\n",
      "\n",
      "America’s legal case reflected both the long reach of its sanctions and their unique severity against Iran. In April the Trump administration had designated the IRGC as a foreign terrorist organisation, against the advice of American military and intelligence officials. The ship’s “deceptive voyages” were part of large-scale money-laundering operation, complained America’s Department of Justice. That cut no ice with Gibraltar. It pointed out that the EU’s sanctions laws differ from America’s, and that Europeans—like the rest of the world—treat the IRGC as unsavoury actors rather than outright terrorists.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Adrian Darya 1 may yet struggle to sell its wares; America has threatened to impose sanctions on anyone doing business with her. But she has probably escaped America’s clutches. Even the Trump administration is likely to rule out nabbing the ship in international waters, which would cause an outcry. And courts in Greece—where she is due to arrive on August 25th—will prove no more pliant than those in Gibraltar.\n",
      "\n",
      "Nevertheless, the diplomatic tussle has put Britain in a difficult position. In May Hassan Rouhani, Iran’s president, warned that unless the deal’s other signatories—including Europe, China and Russia—helped Iran withstand the tightening vice of American sanctions, it would begin steadily violating elements of the deal, inching closer to the ability to build nuclear weapons. It has started to act on that threat. Iran is also said to have warned, privately, that unless it can export 1.5m barrels of oil per day, far more than it does now, it will walk away (oil makes up about a third of Iran’s government budget).\n",
      "\n",
      "Like its European allies, Britain wants to encourage Iran to remain in compliance. It has made sincere efforts to that end. In January it spearheaded, with France and Germany, the creation of Instex, a barter mechanism that would facilitate certain types of Europe-Iran transactions, particularly for humanitarian supplies. British diplomats say they remain eager to soothe Iran with continued trade. But the seizure of the Adrian Darya 1—with its 2.1m barrels of oil—threw a spanner in the works, not least because Britain was prodded into action by American intelligence.\n",
      "\n",
      "Further complicating matters, Britain’s government changed hands midway through the crisis; on July 24th, Boris Johnson succeeded Theresa May as prime minister, and appointed new foreign and defence ministers. Mr Johnson has adopted a confrontational attitude to European partners over the terms of Britain’s departure from the European Union, saying Britain would leave the EU as scheduled on October 31st, with or without a deal. He has also courted the Trump administration, which is keen to encourage Brexit and is holding out the prospect of a speedy free-trade deal between Britain and America to help cushion the British economy.\n",
      "\n",
      "That leaves Britain’s Iran policy in a parlous position. Should Mr Johnson continue to side with the Europeans, he may anger America, placing at risk the promise of a post-Brexit economic deal. But if he sides with Mr Trump and heaps more pressure on Iran, he would risk a complete collapse in the teetering nuclear deal and a spat with Europe. “You can't maintain that post-Brexit you'll be a loyal ally of European nations in matters of security and ditch 20 years of Iran policy by moving over to the American side,” says Richard Dalton, who served as Britain's ambassador to Iran between 2003 and 2006. “If Britain is to have any influence in the world, it's got to keep intact the relationships with France and Germany in order to continue to be a bridge between America and Europe.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Thus far, Mr Johnson has continued to seek a balance. Whereas Mrs May’s government had tried to corral a group of European states in a maritime-security mission for the Persian Gulf—in marked preference to one involving America—Mr Johnson’s government quickly signed up to the American-led scheme. John Bolton, Mr Trump’s national security adviser, visiting Britain on August 12th, noted with pleasure that the choice “reflects a change from the prior government”. But the release of the Adrian Darya 1 shows that even Mr Johnson is unwilling to break with European partners and join Mr Trump in trying to throttle Iran. At least not yet.\n"

Umar is a son of Mahmud, who later co-founded another successful web-based label, PrettyLittleThing, and sold most of it to Boohoo. The Manchester-based group has come a long way fast.\n",
      "\n",
      "Its annual sales have reached £857m ($1.1bn) and it is the highest-valued firm on , the London Stock Exchange’s junior bourse. It has yet to achieve the scale of a Primark or & , but it is becoming hard to ignore. On August 6th Boohoo bought the brands Karen Millen and Coast. Disregarding lamentations about the demise of the high street, it said it would swiftly shut their 200-odd physical outlets.\n",
      "\n",
      "The company’s headquarters in Manchester, meanwhile, is part building site owing to its expansion. For a fashion firm the reception area is unusually cluttered, and even grimy. Above it are floor upon floor of racks of clothes next to designers, hair-and-make-up artists with models in studios churning out looks for the websites. Speed is of the essence. Boohoo can design, manufacture and send out tiny batches—300 pieces—of a particular design in two weeks, so it is extremely responsive to its customers. That compares with around six weeks at Inditex, owner of Zara, a Spanish giant whose trajectory Boohoo would like to match.\n",
      "\n",
      "In addition to speed, two further ideas are helping Boohoo disrupt fast fashion. It was the first to use social-media influencers on an industrial scale—it has a network in the tens of thousands. Keeping up with all the new ones can be hard, says Ms Kane. “Love Island”, a reality- show featuring dozens of comely people locked in a villa and encouraged to couple up, is a reliable source. Not that celebrity looks are required to wear clothes from Boohoo or Nasty Gal, another of its brands. The group’s second innovation was to embrace the “body-positivity” movement and make high fashion available in very large sizes, beyond -size 20 ( -size 16).\n",
      "\n",
      "With a market value of £2.6bn and plenty of cash, Boohoo wants to build on its expansion into America and Europe and strike more deals. In March Mr Kamani and Ms Kane brought in a new chief executive, John Lyttle, a former chief operating officer of Primark. The stockmarket is watching to see if Boohoo can keep up its growth and maintain high profitability.\n",
      "\n",
      "The firm is paying only so much attention to how big companies are meant to behave. Mr Kamani, who with Ms Kane is its entrepreneurial force (he owns 16.1%), is still in charge. As part of the shuffle he was made executive chairman, prompting Boohoo’s non-executive chairman, a retail veteran, to leave. “It is not conventional corporate governance,” says Richard Watts at Merian Global Investors, which owns 14.8% of Boohoo and which backed the change. “But Mr Kamani has been critical to the success of the firm.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Some of Boohoo’s operations may require new thinking. In January a committee of s named it, with Amazon and Sports, as “least engaged” with two problems of fast fashion. These are the use of illegally cheap labour, and waste from people wearing cheap clothes once or twice and then binning them. Boohoo was not accused of underpaying any workers. But it is a big contractor in Leicester, where, says a 2015 report by the city’s university, most garment workers earn below the minimum wage. Ms Kane says she is proud of manufacturing in Britain, and the firm ensures its suppliers use electronic payrolls rather than cash, so pay is easier to audit.\n",
      "\n",
      "Boohoo’s feistiness suits its customers (who did not boycott it after media coverage of rag-trade work conditions). The tagline to a selection of Boohoo clothes picked out by Zendaya, an American actress, on the wall in Manchester sums it up: “When you’re being yelled at and you’re waiting for them to finish so you can hit them with facts.” Boohoo’s facts are millions of young customers and runaway growth, a combo that seldom goes out of style. ■\n",
      "B were formed at the start of the year. Both parties are led by ex-City boys. Both parties gave the Conservatives a battering at an election in May. The Residents for Guildford and Villages ( 4 ) may attract less attention than the Brexit Party—but they could still cause the Conservatives a problem.\n",
      "\n",
      "A backlash against proposals to build up to 14,600 new houses in and around Guildford, a commuter town in Surrey, led to the Tories slumping from 34 of 48 councillors in the previous local election to just nine this year. By contrast, the upstart 4 , registered only two months before, went from no seats to 15. “It’s Faragesque,” says Joss Bigmore, a banker turned 4 politico.\n",
      "\n",
      "This was no isolated hit. The Conservatives suffered across the south-east. In nearby Tandridge, where a plan to build 4,000 homes on protected green-belt land was angrily attacked by locals, the Tories lost control of the council, with voters drifting to residents’ groups and independents. In Essex, Residents for Uttlesford, which was founded partly to oppose the local council’s controversial planning schemes, gained 17 seats. The Conservatives lost 19.\n",
      "\n",
      "Housing is an existential problem for the Tories. As a rough rule, people who own their homes are more likely to be Conservative (in the general election of 2017, 55% of owner-occupiers voted Tory, while 54% of private renters voted Labour). So the falling rate of homeownership—now, at 64%, back to its level in the mid-1980s—is ominous for the party. No wonder, then, that the housing department says it is “unashamedly and relentlessly” focused on boosting this figure.\n",
      "\n",
      "Yet more building can lead to a backlash, as Tory councillors in Guildford and beyond can attest. It represents a Conservative catch-22: the party must build houses to attract new voters, but cannot do so without annoying their current backers.\n",
      "\n",
      "Guildford demonstrates why. Even if every site in the local housing plan were built on, the area would still be green and pleasant. Green-belt land would fall from making up 89% of the borough to 86.4%. A disused airfield, which is classed as green-belt despite being a big slab of concrete, is one of the sites earmarked for housing. “Areas of outstanding natural beauty”—the picture-postcard parts—would be almost entirely untouched. If the local council did not impose its own plan, then the government would foist one on the area with even less input from locals, says Paul Spooner, the former Tory leader of Guildford council. Yet this defence fell on deaf ears. Mr Spooner was hoofed out in May, replaced by Liberal Democrat leadership.\n",
      "\n",
      "4 insists it is not a party of s. Given that Guildford is choked by green belt, some building on surrounding fields is inevitable, admits Mr Bigmore. Opposition to the housing plan—which ran to some 750-pages, along with piles of supporting documents—was based on its process and execution rather than its objectives. The scheme had been rammed through an extraordinary meeting of the council, just a week before the election.\n",

      "Under the current planning system, there is little scope for winning round housing sceptics. The benefits of development seep out of the area: extra tax revenue generated by new residents tends to flow to central government rather than to the local authority. “Local government bears the political risk, without seeing much reward,” says Anthony Breach of the Centre for Cities, a think-tank. With a target for house-building imposed on the council by the government, villagers and townies end up pitted against each other, trying to shove development elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "For now, the political damage is quarantined at a local level. Each of the Conservatives’ 11 s in Surrey sits on a fat majority. But councillors draw a parallel with austerity, where the government outsourced the blame for cuts by forcing local councils to decide what to axe. When it comes to housing, Tory s will hope the firewall between local politics and Westminster holds for longer. ■\n",
      "B lacks a written constitution, relying a lot on convention instead. Analysts pore over documents such as the ministerial code and the cabinet manual for guidance. Boris Johnson’s threat of a no-deal Brexit could test this informal system to destruction.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the queen’s prerogative powers. In fact, she takes advice from her prime minister, whose government commands a majority of s. Yet a clash between Parliament and prime minister over a no-deal Brexit could break the cabinet manual’s rule that the queen “should not be drawn into party politics”.\n",
      "\n",
      "If s vote no confidence in the government, the Fixed-term Parliaments Act allows 14 days for an alternative to be found. Mr Johnson would remain prime minister and could seek to thwart this. Other advisers, notably the queen’s private secretary, Edward Young, the cabinet secretary, Sir Mark Sedwill, and the principal private secretary in Downing Street, Peter Hill, may counteract this, but only if it is clear that somebody else can win a Commons majority.\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson could also advise the queen to hold an election after a no-deal Brexit on October 31st. The cabinet manual says it is “customary” during an election to defer the “taking or announcing of major policy decisions”. Robert Hazell of the constitution unit thinks this custom implies not letting an irreversible no-deal Brexit happen. But as this is the default option under current law, no-dealers fervently disagree.\n",
      "\n",
      "More problems may come if an election produces another hung parliament. In 2010 the cabinet secretary, Gus O’Donnell, facilitated talks between David Cameron and Nick Clegg. In 2017 Theresa May spent days negotiating with the Northern Irish Democratic Unionists, delaying the Queen’s Speech (at the risk of making the monarch late for the Royal Ascot horse races).\n",
      "\n",
      "Mr Johnson’s government also plans to stop s legislating to demand another extension of the Brexit deadline. Yet the Speaker, John Bercow, says that Parliament must be heard before a no-deal Brexit. He too is bound by conventions, in this case set out in “Erskine May”, the bible of Commons procedure (available free online since July). But in January he overruled precedent, and his own clerks, to allow an amendment from Remainers to a motion that would normally be unamendable. Nobody can challenge the Speaker’s rulings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Vernon Bogdanor of King’s College London thinks Brexit is pushing the constitution to its limits, especially on citizens’ rights and devolution. It might even lead to a written constitution and more judicial oversight—just as Brexiteers crow over sovereignty regained.■\n"
